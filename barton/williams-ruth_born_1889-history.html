<h3 id="1889_1964">(1889­- 1964)</h3>

<p>[Portrait]</p>

<p>March 22, 1889, was a very eventful day in the lives of Ruth and Jeremiah Williams. I was on this day that another little Ruth was born. She was the eighth child in a family of thirteen children—nine boys and four girls. During Ruth’s life she followed in the footsteps of her mother, having thirteen children of her own—nine girls and four boys. Cleo Williams was the oldest, then John Williams and Ruth, making it the third generation of Ruths. The rest of the children were: Verda, Emma Pearl, Mary, Lucille, Alta, William (Bill) Williams, Faye, Ann Edith (Patsy) and Jerry Doyle.</p>

<p>Ruth’s mother died at the age of 54. Prior to her death she developed an abnormal growth on her wrist and had to have her arm partially amputated. At the time of her death her son, Will, was on a mission. This left Jim, Joel, Henry and Bud for Ruth’s father to raise. As the boys grew older and went away to school, Ruth helped with the washing and ironing of their clothes. This she did on the scrubbing board and the old stove irons. Bud, being the youngest and living close to Ruth, was more like one of her own. Later in life they shared many happy hours reminiscing about the past. Ruth’s other living brother, Henry, lived in California. His visits to Idaho will always be remembered by his nephews and nieces, as his coming meant a family reunion, renewing acquaintances again, and having plenty of home made ice cream.</p>

<p>At the age of six, Ruth had diphtheria and then the black measles. She was a sick little girl for some time. Ruth attended the Presbyterian school for a while then she went to the district school. She was one of the few that had a double slate to work on.</p>

<p>When Ruth graduated from eighth grade, they went over to the Court House to take the examination. That night they stayed at the hotel and had supper. This was quite an event for those days. Ruth’s brother, Will, was the teacher and the principal of the school and her father was the president of the school board. It was a class of all girls with the exception of one boy, David A. Evans. They played baseball on Friday when school let out early. This and dancing were about the only sports they had.</p>

<p>Ruth’s father was a staunch democrat. As a token of respect for them they wore large democratic buttons on their lapels at his funeral service.</p>

<p>When Ruth was seventeen, she started to go with John Price. She was married on February 9, 1907, at the age of eighteen. Their marriage was later solemnized in the Logan Temple. Although her home was small, it was always spotless. Ruth’s father stayed with them for a while when his health was so bad. He felt at home there and Ruth enjoyed having the privilege of caring for him. After her father’s death she was left the family home where she and John later moved with their family. Her son, William (Bill) was the first child born there. It was at this time the children all had smallpox. Her husband had several pox on his eyes and it became necessary for him to go to Salt Lake City and see a doctor.</p>

<p>Ruth got her first electric washer when Patsy was a baby. Washing was quite a chore in those days. The water had to be dipped in tubs or barrels and stood by the side of the canal until it was clear. The copper wash boiler was put on the coal stove and the water heated. All of the white clothes had to be boiled to be sure they were clean. The water was very hard. Homemade soap was used that Ruth had made. The drinking water and water used in the home was hauled in a 50-gallon barrel from the Samaria spring. It was a two-mile trip down the back to get the water. During the year, 1941, Ernest Waldron dug a well on the property. This was a big occasion for all the family.</p>

<p>Ruth’s kitchen was her pride and joy. She loved to cook and was always known for her baking powder biscuits and pickles. In the fall of the year friends and relatives would ask her to make their pickles and fruit cake for them. She also made faggots and head cheese for others. She was loved and known by all as Aunt Ruth. At the time her family was small she worked in the Church, but as her family grew she found it necessary to devote her time and efforts toward rearing her family. She always felt her time was well spent, as a Sunday never went by without some member of their family calling on them.</p>

<p>In later years, after her husband, John, retired, they spent much of their time fishing at Lava or on a stream or reservoir near by. Ruth wasn’t a lover of fishing like her husband, but she enjoyed the outing and the picnic lunches that were packed for the trip.</p>

<p>One of the choice memories of the children of John and Ruth was their mother and father’s 50th Wedding Anniversary celebration. It was at this time John and Ruth realized what a rich and full life they had lived as their 13 children, 54 grandchildren, and 11 great grandchildren danced around them. At that time money could not have bought the joy and satisfaction that was theirs when they beheld the posterity they had to bless their home.</p>

<p>Ruth was a wonderful person and her life was truly exemplified by the love and devotion she showed for her family and friends. Her children have often remarked that they never heard their mother and father quarrel. She was especially outstanding with the young people. Her grandchildren will always remember the long talks they used to have with her and the bits of advice she would pass on to them. She never believed in running others lives. She always used to say, ‘’Make sure your own dooryard is swept clean before you sweep the neighbors.“ Ruth and her husband had the mark of faith. They understood their duty as they taught their children the spirit of becoming independent, ambitious and of being worthwhile citizens. The family of Ruth and John Price has grown up with a love for home, for one another, and with a deep love for their parents. They know the meaning of ”Home Sweet Home.“</p>
