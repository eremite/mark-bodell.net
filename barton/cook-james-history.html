<h1 id="james_cook_history">James Cook History</h1>

<p>James was born in Newport Shropshire England in 1816 and married Ann Lane at Wolverhampton, Staffordshire England in 1843. When he was 27 and she was 24. Ann was born in Brewood, Staffordshire, England. I looked on the map and found all these towns less than 10 miles apart.</p>

<p>In February of 1951 Ann and James were baptized members of the church. By this time they had had 4 children, but only 2 were living. Two years later they left England with a group of English and Welsh saints. The ship Jersey went from Liverpool to New Orleans. They only had one death on the ship. Then they went by steamer up the Mississippi to Keokuk. At the stops the saints set up guards on the ship so people would not come off the land and try to steal their possessions. The robbers would ask to see Robert O’Connor or any other Irish name because many ships had people from Ireland on them, but this company was just English and Welsh and so they were not as vulnerable.</p>

<p>At Keokuk they bought wagons, cattle and food for their journey. Some in the company had come from England in what was called the 10 pound company. They were trying to make the whole trip on only ten pounds per person. They had ten people and 3 cows per wagon. This caused the company to be short on food by time they reached the valley. The leader of their company was a nephew to Brigham Young, Joseph Watson Young. He had married a year earlier and his young wife was very ill. Brother Young left the company early calling new leaders. James Cook was called as a captain of 10 wagons. Brother Young only made it to the crossing of the Green River before his wife died. He took her body on into Salt Lake City then returned to help his company.</p>

<p>At one time a group of 500 Pawnee Indians stopped the company near their village and demanded payment before allowing the company to move on. They threatened the company until each family gave up something such as knives, kettles, watches, jewelry, etc. Another time the 10 that James was leading was left behind because they were short on oxen to move their group. But they were able to catch up.</p>

<p>James and Ann and their two children moved to Manti the spring following their arrival in the valley. James arrived there with only 10 cents in his pocket, but he worked hard and was able to build an adobe rock home that still stands today. He became a successful farmer owning 30 acres of land. He also was a wagon maker or wheelwright.</p>

<p>In Manti the family continued to grow until Ann had given birth to 9 children. The first daughter married another of my great-great grandfathers as his 3rd wide. The 3rd daughter of Ann and James married the son of that great-great grandfather and they are the ones I descend through.</p>

<p>Like other men of his time James took more than one wife. About the time Ann’s youngest child was born James was sealed to a lady who had come to Utah with her only two living children. Her husband, a hatter remained behind in England. James never lived with this wife, Hannah. He just supported her and her children. But he did marry Hannah’s daughter, Maria, a divorcée with two children. He cared for the children from her previous marriage as if they were his own. In fact after Maria and Ann died the census says that Maria’s 14 year old boy and Ann’s 15 year old daughter were still living with him.</p>

<p>In Manti the family struggled to have enough food to eat the first years they were there because of what was called the grasshopper war. They ate pigweed, thistles, and sego lily root. They also had problems with Indians and James and his son-in-law to be my great grandfather Barton fought in the Blackhawk war for a few months. The family years later received a tombstone for James for his labors in the war. James outlived all three of his wives dying at 90 years of age.</p>
