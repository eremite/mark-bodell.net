<p>I was born in the town of Catria (Catterall) in the northwest of Lanashire, England. On the sixteenth day of March (1828) about twenty-five minutes after five o&#8217;clock in the morning. Lived there about eighteen months after I was born, after which my parents moved to Carlisle in the north of England in the shire of Cumberland. There we lived about four years.</p>

<p>While in Catria (Catteral) my father was out of his mind for about eight months. By the help of God he recovered. After living in Carlisle for four years, my father being a printer by trade and business failing, we moved to Manchester and stayed there about one year.</p>

<p>Then we moved to Suniside, four miles from Burnley, and there I went to work for the first time. My work was tearing cauler for my father, and I worked for him, receiving or by allowed for my work two shillings and six pence per week. After working in Suniside for about one year, when work began to fail I went with my father to Burnley and worked about six months.</p>

<p>Then we worked at Ruff Cluft, about one mile from Suniside. While we stayed at Suniside, my father there gave me about eight months of schooling, which is all the schooling I have had with the exception of night school. We moved to Manchester after staying at Ruff Cluft about one year. When we arrived at Manchester, my father got me work at the River Print Works, and there I received three shillings per week. I worked there in the Dye house for about one year. Then my father got me work at Mrs. Thomas Hayles and Sons. I worked there in the dry room, receiving four shillings per week.</p>

<p>In about two years I got removed out of the dry room and got work at Pleating Dauran for the Print Machines, receiving four and six pence per week, and worked at that for two years, during which time my mother and my father he having been baptized and desiring my mother and myself to be baptized, we went down and were baptized.</p>

<h2 id='my_baptism_mothers_death_1841_to_1844'>MY BAPTISM MOTHER&#8217;S DEATH 1841 to 1844</h2>

<p>My mother was baptized by Elder Parley P. Pratt and I was baptized by my father, both at the same moment of time on the night of the Twenty-ninth of November 1841. My mother recovered a little, but after an illness of three years she died. Her disease was the dropsy.</p>

<p>During her sickness I was very attentive. After returning home at night I would rub her legs, which were swelled, and the rubbing would make her feel considerably easier. I took a delight in so doing as I loved my mother as much as a son could do. But it seemed that it was the Lord&#8217;s will that she should leave this world, and on the Twenty-third day of February 1843, she died.</p>

<p>After my mother&#8217;s death I would, by my father&#8217;s request, would every week clean up the house and cook some things so that it would save him from hiring anyone, which I did for about one year, and during which time I had by my own industry and cunningness applied and did get promoted in the laboratory which received six shillings per week and stayed in the cautery shop about six months, learning and studying all I could, and going to the night school four nights a week, which cost my father two pence per week.</p>

<p>After my mother had been dead about one year and a half, my father took another wife. She behaved kind to me and my younger brother.</p>

<p>NB My father had by my own mother three sons. One what two years older, and the other was two years and six months younger than I. My eldest brother&#8217;s name is Robert Shenton (Barton). My youngest brother&#8217;s name is Stephen Cornel (Barton). My father had by my step-mother three children.</p>

<p>After my father&#8217;s second marriage my step-mother wished me to work in a cotton factory as I would get more wages, and I feeling desirous to understand all the branches of cotton markets, it met my mind, and I went to work in the factory. This was in 1844.</p>

<h2 id='working_in_cotton_factory_my_own_marriage_1844_to_1847'>WORKING IN COTTON FACTORY MY OWN MARRIAGE 1844 to 1847</h2>

<p>I worked in the factory about nine months until I thought I understood the business. Just before I left I had my hand caught in a piece of machinery, and was badly hurt. This accident happened on a Saturday between ten PM and eight o&#8217;clock AM. After my hand got well. I applied for a situation at Thomas Hayles Print Works, the place I formerly worked and succeeded. I worked at what is termed a back-tender for printing machines. Stayed at Hayles two years, then I removed to Liverpool and worked for my brother Shenton at Leather Curries.</p>

<p>I took up the business very fast and in nine months I was a competent hand at the business, having all the chance to learn all its branches. My brother made arrangements to leave the country and go to America and give up his business. My brother had a companion at this time. He wanted to go with him. He also wanted him to marry my brother&#8217;s wife&#8217;s sister, but she was not willing as I had been keeping company with her about this time.</p>

<p>My brother and his wife sailed for Philadelphia on the Twentieth of August 1847 leaving me to do the best I could for myself. In two weeks I had made sufficient means to pay for passage for two persons to New Orleans. I then applied to George Hewitt and his wife Jane for their daughter Malinda Jane (Hewitt) for a wife. They both gave me their consent and also their daughter. We were married at Saint Luke&#8217;s Church in Liverpool, top of Bald Street, on the Twenty-ninth day of August 1847 between nine and ten A.M.</p>

<p>I then paid passage to New Orleans to sail on the Charlemagne, to sail on the First of September, but she did not sail until the Eleventh of September. On the Eleventh we sailed out of dock and stayed anchored in the river until six o&#8217;clock on Monday morning. Then the tug boat came and hitched on and took us out to sea. Had head winds for ten days. After we had good winds until we landed.</p>

<h2 id='landing_in_new_orleans_1847'>LANDING IN NEW ORLEANS. 1847</h2>

<p>We sailed up the Mississippi River, crossing the bars about six o&#8217;clock in the evening of Saturday, running up the river with the help of any steamer landing at the lower cotton press at about ten o&#8217;clock on Sunday morning the fifth of November 1847. We landed with six pence after paying half a crown for our luggage hauled to a house we had rented, and paying a half a crown to the Custom House Officer.</p>

<p>The first mate of the vessel asked me if I wanted any money. I told him of my circumstances and he gave me three dollars, telling me if I made anything before the vessel sailed back, I could pay him back, but if not I could keep it. I thanked him and acknowledged the hand of God in it.</p>

<p>After being three days in New Orleans I could not find anybody that I knew. I saw on a horning post a card with direction to an intelligence officer. I immediately applied. He then told me of many situations, such as opening oysters, waiting at a bar, etc but it did not meet my mind, so I refused. He then told me to came again in the morning, so I went.</p>

<p>He then asked me if I could paint. I told him that was not my business but I was willing to try. He told me to say that I had earned my time as an apprentice. He then took me to a paint shop carried on by a man by the name of ____________ from Manchester. He asked me many questions. I told him I worked at Thomas Hayles and Sons for thirteen years, which I had, and a part of the time at painting, but had not served a regular apprenticeship. He told me that I could go to work and he would pay me what I was worth.</p>

<p>I then went to work for him and on Saturday night he asked me what would satisfy me for wages. I told him I would leave it to himself.</p>

<h1 id='1848'>1848</h1>

<p>He then asked the foreman, but he could not say as he had not noticed, which was the case. The master then said that all the old country workmen were not worth as much as those who had been in this country for some time, as we worked slower and did not understand the mode of working, so if I was satisfied, he would give me a guinea, which was five dollars, for my three days work, so I of course accepted it and thanked him kindly. I felt God had been with me and was helping me. I worked for him until March. He gave me two-and-one-half dollars per week for the last two months. When I was leaving, he offered me three dollars per week if I would stay through the summer. When I got on a boat for Saint Louis he gave me a good recommend to Mr. Burry, who kept a paint shop in Saint Louis. He also gave me two bottles of Porter and some other little notions.</p>

<p>Note on margin: My father died on Twenty-third of May 1848. My borther Shenton&#8217;s wife died twenty minutes past eight A.M. Tenth of July 1848.</p>

<p>I arrived in Saint Louis the middle of April. Work was hard to be got. I applied to Mr. Burry and showed him the recommend, but he did not want any more hands at the time.</p>

<p>After renting a house, I applied for a situation as a waiter at the Peoples Garden and got it, getting one-and one-half dollars per night. After being there sometime my brother Shenton and his wife arrived from Philadelphia, his wife being very sick. She died in the same house as we lived in, it being right on the same block, right in the center of the Gardens. She died four days after their arrival, Tenth of July 1848.</p>

<p>My brother got work at Mr Sheffield&#8217;s Tannery and Curries on the Fourth of July 1848. The Garden, or part of the building, was destroyed by fire. I was then receiving sixteen dollars per month and house rent and living free and our provisions. I had charge of the bar and the management of making ice cream and of all the waiters. Through the fire, the Gardens was given up. I then got work at Sheffield Tannery on Twentieth Street and Morgan Street. I worked there about six months.</p>

<h2 id='working_at_currying_in_saint_louis__my_brother_living_in_saint_louis'>WORKING AT CURRYING IN SAINT LOUIS # MY BROTHER LIVING IN SAINT LOUIS</h2>

<p>Then my brother felt, assumed by his actions, that I should not do so well as him, and he turned the Master against me so I left and got work at Mister Blackburns on the prairie at currying, getting two dollars per week more. Stayed two weeks and my brother Shenton told Mr. Blackburn that I had not served my time at the business, but Mr. Blackburn said he had no fault to find with my work. I then thought if working at currying should hurt my brother&#8217;s feelings, I would try to get work at painting, so applied to Mister Burry for work, reminding him of my recommend from New Orleans. He gave me work and kept me at work steady with the exception of very bad weather through the winter while I stayed in Saint Louis. This would be in 1849.</p>

<p>About twelve days after I had gone to work at painting, my brother left Saint Louis, taking with him the daughter of Mr. Sheffield, contrary to Mr. Sheffield&#8217;s will or consent, or even his knowledge. My brother about this time seems to be kind of loose and fond of his liquor and women. However, I felt to thank God that I was differently disposed. My brother at this time was owing me about twenty dollars for board and washing.</p>

<p>I kept some of his good socks and bedding. He and a companion came to my house the night before he left and demanded his things, but I refused the let him have them. He came to my house about twelve o&#8217;clock at night when I refused he then drew a pistol and swore he would shoot me if I resisted him in taking all his things away. He refused to pay me for his board.</p>

<h1 id='arrival'>ARRIVAL</h1>

<p>I then went out of the house and it seemed that he thought that I had gone to Mr. Sheffield&#8217;s so he took a few things and left. This happened in October 1848.</p>

<p>On the First of November twenty minutes to nine A.M. My wife delivered a son. I had him named and blessed by the Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Third Street between Market and Chestnut Street, Saint Louis, Missouri. His name was given thus: William George Barton.</p>

<p>I got nine dollars per week painting. Kept me and my family. In the fall of 1849 Brother Erastus Snow and others came down to Saint Louis from the Valley of Salt Lake City. I bought a span of horses of Erastus Snow. Paid him seventy-five dollars for them. The horses were very poor. I kept them through the winter and fed them well.</p>

<p>In the spring I bought a wagon and started for Kanesville, Iowa, taking with me a female passenger by the name of Smith. She was to pay me fifty dollars and pay for her board.</p>

<p>NB My wife&#8217;s father and mother came from England in the spring of 1849, and brother came in the fall of 1848. Her brother stopped with us for a little while as I went up to the River Mission to work. My mother-in-law died in Saint Louis about six weeks before we left and my father-in-law started up the river a few days before we started. His name was George Hewitt and my wife&#8217;s mother&#8217;s name was Jane Hewitt. Her maiden name was Pickering. My brother-in-law&#8217;s name is George Frederick Hewitt.</p>

<p>We traveled by land through Missouri on our way to Salt Lake. Had to buy another horse at Saint Charles. Paid forty dollars for it. Borrowed some money of My&#8217;s (?) Smith. Got to Kanesville after traveling five weeks over a land route. Found that the team would not take.</p>

<h2 id='arrived_at_kanesville_my_child_died_my_wifes_fathers_death__ethelbert'>ARRIVED AT KANESVILLE MY CHILD DIED MY WIFE&#8217;S FATHER&#8217;S DEATH # ETHELBERT,</h2>

<h1 id='my_second_son_born'>MY SECOND SON BORN</h1>

<p>The horse I bought at Saint Charles I had to sell on the road before I arrived at Kanesville. Got for it of a saint we found on the road about forty miles below Kanesville, two cows and two calves and a side of bacon and one chicken. Arrived in Kanesville in May 1850. Sold the cows and my horses and wagon and built a log house and commenced painting so that I could make a fit-out for the valley.</p>

<p>On the Twelfth of August 1850 about nine or ten in the morning my first son, William George, died of cholera infection, after a sickness of about two months.</p>

<p>His death was very striking and heart rending. He put up his little fingers first to my lips and then move them to his mother&#8217;s lips for a kiss, and then move them back again, and kept on doing so for about twenty minutes before his spirit departed, looking up at us with a kind of smile until at last a scum came over his eyes. He did not seem to suffer much. I looked on actions as a token of his wishing his mother and me to have union and keep together.</p>

<p>NB After our arrival we found that my wife&#8217;s father had died of cholera three days before our arrival. The Sunday before my child died I went to the burying ground and in helping to dig a grave for a Mrs. Evans I came across my father-in-law&#8217;s coffin and knew it by the description given me, so in the afternoon of my child&#8217;s death I made a coffin for him myself, and he was buried the same day.</p>

<p>October the Third-thirty minutes past twelve noon, 1850 my wife was confined and brought forth a son, we named Ethelbert Hewitt Barton. He was blessed and named by the elders in Kanesville.</p>

<p>Work seemed very full and it was hard getting along. Although I seemed to do better than the other painters, yet it was hard. In the spring of 1851 I agreed with Daniel Grenig, a baker, to go into partnership and put up a bake-oven. I bought a cow of David Candland and had milk for about three or four months, and then she got in a ditch and got the stogers and died. Not much doing not much emigration in the winter of 1851.</p>

<p>I went on the bluffs and cut down some oak trees, and split them up, seasoned it as well as I could and made two running gears of wagon, and intended to sell one for the ironing of the other and then try and get off to the Valley of Salt Lake. During the winter I got in debt sixty-three or sixty-four dollars for provisions and clothing, and lived very poor as flour was very dear.</p>

<p>Through the River Missouri being frozen and no boats running, I was accused of shooting a cow belonging to a brother ___________, and I did not do it, but no doubt I had hurt it the night before, as it had done me some damage in the winter.</p>

<p>I went down in Mills County and did some painting and a large job of plastering for Brother Cooledge, which I got through very well, not letting him know but what plastering was my business, and the Lord seemed to help me.</p>

<p>In the early part of Spring Brother Ezra T. Benson, one of the Twelve Apostles, and Brother I.C. Little came to my house and wished me to give the two running gears to them for the benefit of the poor. They said if I would, I should get a way, and the Lord would bless me. I gave them and trusted to God to help me gain means so that I might get to the Valley this year.</p>

<h2 id='getting_my_outfit_in_the_states_for_the_valley_1852'>GETTING MY OUTFIT IN THE STATES FOR THE VALLEY 1852</h2>

<p>About three or four weeks after, I fixed the oven and commenced preparing for emigration. Daniel Grenig was in partners with me. The oven was on my property. Had bad luck with the oven. Daniel and myself could not agree after we had commenced working and emigration had come in. Dissolved partnership on condition that he paid me a tenth of all he made and him work the oven.</p>

<p>My wife and myself commenced and kept a kind of boarding house for the emigrants - charged fifty cents a meal, and also commenced baking light bread. We also had the selling of Grenig&#8217;s bread, as he could not sell it at his own house and he gave us one cent on very loaf. The only reason he could not sell his own was because I had my place fixed up like a shop and plenty of signs up in front.</p>

<p>Then I commenced and made lemonade and cakes, and kept a stand on the main street and made considerable means by so doing. In about two weeks after I had commenced, I thought I could make lemonade powder, which thing I accomplished, and hired a man to mind my store while I attended to making the powders up. I sold it for fifty cents per pound.</p>

<p>I also had a good many goggles glasses cut, which brought me a cent a glass and in five weeks after I commenced I had made my outfit, which consisted of a span of horses, one yoke of oxen, two yokes of cows, and a good wagon. I sold my house and lot for twenty-three dollars and an old wagon which I traded off. Paid the sixty-three or sixty-four dollars which I owed and bought my flour and bacon and started with five cents in cash, but had plenty of coffee, sugar, tea, soap.</p>

<h2 id='crossing_the_plains'>CROSSING THE PLAINS</h2>

<p>Some of the brethren had some words with the captain of fifty. As we got on the road the captain would almost every day resign his office in the morning, noon, and night because things did not go on right to his notion. The brethren got dissatisfied with his ways and concluded to break up the company unless he would change his means of governing, thus when we arrived at Wood River, which is about two-hundred miles from Winter Quarters, I asked leave to go alone with my ten as I did not like contention and dissention.</p>

<p>The captain gave me orders to join to the company, and I gave them (orders) just as he had given them to me, and the brethren did not like them, but as soon as he found they did not approve of them, he denied giving them to me as I had given them. Well, he lied and I knew it so that was one reason I wished to go ahead and not travel with him.</p>

<p>He told me when I asked him if I might leave that I could go, so I went and told my ten if they had a mind to come along they could so they could still keep the organization. We had been three weeks in traveling to Wood River from the Missouri River. They did not come with me, so I left them and started on alone with my wagon and family and my wife&#8217;s brother.</p>

<p>NB I learned after getting in the Valley that the day after I had left the company, the company by the captain&#8217;s request moved him from his berth and made another captain, but Mr. Great House was not willing to be governed. Finally, the company all broke up and moved in small parties. Also (Out House) after he arrived in the Valley he bids out of the Church and went to California and all his family.</p>

<p>I traveled some time alone and some time with two other wagons that were going to the Valley. One of the wagons was owned by Captain Hawley, a member of the Church, the other by a Californian. We traveled in peace. I got here in the Valley on the Twentieth of August 1852. Met Brother John Lowe between the Little and Big Mountains.</p>

<h2 id='arrival_in_the_valley_buying_of_a_house_and_lot__commenced_work_my_child'>ARRIVAL IN THE VALLEY BUYING OF A HOUSE AND LOT # COMMENCED WORK MY CHILD</h2>

<h1 id='very_sick_1852'>VERY SICK 1852</h1>

<p>While between the mountains I had twenty acres of land surveyed for a farm as Brother Lowe and Abram Chadwick were having some land surveyed. It never was any use to me or to them as we sold it to pay expenses.</p>

<p>The Company I started with arrived in the Valley. In a secondary condition and was a little over five weeks after I arrived. I sold an ox in the road for forty dollars. Paid my brother Lowe for all he loaned to me on the road. Went down to Brother Lowe&#8217;s house in the Sixth Ward. He and his family received us very kindly. We were acquainted with them in Liverpool and were neighbors to them in Saint Louis, Missouri, and in Kanesville, State of Iowa.</p>

<p>I bought half of his lot and a log cabin and some garden truck. Paid him for it a span of horses. Sold him my wagon. Got twenty dollars in cash from him. I sold the odd ox I brought in for thirty-five dollars. Sold three cows for just what they cost me in Kanesville and kept one until about Christmas and then sold her. I had raised about one-hundred-twenty-five dollars in cash for the stock and etc. then I went and spent it for paint and commenced work.</p>

<p>The first job of any note I did was a house in the Fourteenth Ward belonging to Chauncey West. Took my pay in anything I could get. A part of it I never got. I soon found my paint was all gone and I had realized but little for it.</p>

<p>My little boy about this time was very sick. My wife was pregnant and I began to believe that a certain Elder by the name of Simeon Carter that presided in Liverpool, the birthplace of my wife, Malinda Jane, that because he could not persuade her to become his wife, he had cursed her by the Priesthood so that she could not h a plurality of children living at the same time.</p>

<p>The reason that my wife and myself judged he had cursed her was from his own words. At one time he said to my wife (this was before she was married) or rather wished her to go to his bed. He said he would not harm her or get her in the family way and he swore he would have her if he had to go to hell for her.</p>

<h1 id='better_1852__1853'>BETTER 1852 - 1853</h1>

<p>Other cases of a similar character we knew of where the cursings he had given took effect. But I believed he was not justified in his action and his words. My wife and myself humbled ourselves before the Lord and prayed that if there was any curse on my wife that he would remove it. My child kept dwindling away and there seemed to be no particular disease only pining away. I called in the Elders of the Church and had hands laid on my child for his recovery and I prayed to God to remove the curse as it was unlawful, and let the curse go where it came from and those that wished it, it might fall on them and be removed from my house and I would try and serve God all my days.</p>

<p>December Twenty-fifth, 1852 I took another wife. Was sealed for time and eternity by Ezra T. Benson, one of the Apostles, in the Council House, Great Salt Lake City. Her maiden name was Elizabeth Frances Quirk. Her father&#8217;s name was Thomas Quirk. Her mother&#8217;s name is Mary Ann. She had one sister living by the name of Margrett at the time of her marriage. Elizabeth was born in Liverpool, Ninth November 1832. Her parents were formerly from the Isle of Man. She had one sister by the name of Ann Quirk - died in Saint Louis. Three brothers and one sister died while young - two by the name of John and one by James. The girl by the name of Agnes Emma.</p>

<p>Brother Lowe took another wife at the same time I did. Elizabeth&#8217;s father and mother were present and gave her away to me for time and eternity. I gave the clerk five dollars for his trouble. His name was Thomas Bullock.</p>

<p>On the Sixth of February 1853 my wife Malinda was confined to her bed and brought forth another son. My son Ethelbert got well by the help of God and good care which I was thankful for. I had my child blessed by the elders of the church and named by my wish Walter Kilshaw Hewitt Barton.</p>

<p>I became acquainted about this time with John Sanderson, a man that understood the science of astrology. I began to be interested in the science and I began to study for myself.</p>

<p>My wife&#8217;s brother left this place and went to California. He went as a teamster for the firm of Livingston and Kingkead, receiving small wages. After he got in California he got a situation as a waiter in a hotel. He left some time June 1853.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1853 I commenced building an adobe house. Put up one room. Painting full on account of the scarcity of cash to buy paint so in May 1854 I started in company with John Sanderson and four others on the road to trade with the emigrants.</p>

<p>After being out about five or six weeks I returned and went in partnership with Brother John Lowe making ice cream. Put up a boarded shantie just outside of Brother Lowe&#8217;s shop. After three weeks partnership with Brother Lowe, he kind of got sick of it as it was considerable work to get snow from the mountains as we had no ice put up.</p>

<p>I continued making ice cream and found sale for it. The theatre was open at night and I got the privilege of keeping a stand and selling it to the audience during the performance. I put up three more rooms to my house. I built it in a Gothic style. It looked very well.</p>

<p>On the Thirteenth of April 1854, 30 minutes past Twelve o&#8217;clock A.M. Between the twelfth and thirteenth night, my second wife, Elizabeth was confined to bed and was delivered of a son. Had him blessed and named James Arthur Quirk Barton. Malinda, my wife, was very sick for about three months. I did doubt her recovery at one time. Got Dr. Sproize to attend her. She was bedfast for about one month and two weeks. She was confined to her bed in Brother Lowe&#8217;s home. Got Brother Franklin D. Richards, one of the Twelve Apostles, to come and lay hands on her for the good of her health.</p>

<p>I engaged with Brother Quirk, (my second wife&#8217;s father), to cultivate a five acre lot on shares, giving him one-third. Planted it all in wheat in March. I sold eleven bushels of wheat for ten bushels of seven-headed wheat to a brother living in the Ward (Fulmor), having sold thirteen powder horns for eleven bushels. Also agreed to cultivate a lot above mine and plant wheat. Planted it on the Ninth of March. Hired a span of mules of W. S. Godby at two dollars a day. Got Brother Barlow to plough my lot and a half and also the lot above which belonged to Brother Thompson.</p>

<p>Things and work looked very dull and I could not see any change to provide for my family, only to raise my own provisions and everything I wanted. Did some white-washing for Captain Hardy. I got Brother Barlow to help me. I traded to Thomas Clark from Grantsville, a bed cover, some glasses and some crockery ware to the amount of thirty dollars fa a cow and calf, to get it sometime in the spring. My children seemed to be sick with tumors and boils, more particularly in the head.</p>

<p>Went to a meeting in the afternoon and at night to the Seventies. Was admitted to the Melchizedek Quorum with several others of the brethren that had come to Manti from the city. We were invited on the stand to speak our feeling, which we all accepted. I continued to still the whiskey, and nothing particular happened until the Fifth of June.</p>

<p>We heard that the Sanpitches Indians had killed three men and one woman that were traveling through Salt Creek Canyon, and then burned one of the outfits. They could hardly make it out. The cause was unknown. Bishop Snow just passed. Up to July. I continued to make whiskey and said my means and clothing, all I could spare in calves and sheep. I was appointed to a committee on arrangements to get up a concert for the Twenty-fourth of July. Was also appointed to the presidency of the Seventy&#8217;s Melchizedek Quorum. Brother Bench to take charge and had a chair for this meeting. I worked an astrological figure for Unica Bram and gave judgement she would die, I believed about the middle of July unless saved by the power of the Priesthood. She died Seventeenth July.</p>

<h3 id='twentyfourth_july'>Twenty-fourth July.</h3>

<p>A company of unwanted troops of three hundred passed through Manti about eight A.M., then our Brethren formed and procession at nine-thirty and in the P.M. Went to meeting. An oration was given by Bishop Warren Snow and Brother Peacock. Several toasts were given and our choir gave some anthems and songs. A good spirit prevailed.</p>

<p>In the evening at early candlelight, Brother Garrick and his wife, Sister Peacock, Sisters Broadbent, Luke and Bemys and Brothers W. Warwood, Hall, Bench and Steck assisted me in giving a concert. Several songs were sung, one recitation and sermon and concluded with a farce called &#8220;Seeing the Elephant&#8221;. Prayer be President of Sanpete County, Brother Christiansen.</p>

<p>The performance gave as far as I could learn, general satisfaction to all present and I was highly pleased. We had the faith and prayers of the brethren, I am confident.</p>

<p>I continued to make whiskey. Took out a license paid ten dollars per month. During the fall of this year I bought several lots of goods. Went to Salt Lake City two or three times. Sold the goods in Manti. Furnished my family with things necessary.</p>

<h3 id='ninth_july_1859'>Ninth July 1859</h3>

<p>I quit selling whiskey only in case of sickness and by order of the authorities of Manti. On the fourteenth I was hewing a piece of timber while on the lot with a small hatchet. My son Raphael was passing and the hatchet head flew off and made quite a serious cut close to his left eye. This was about noon.</p>

<p>I put in about sixteen acres of wheat and oats this spring on land leased from Brother Brigham. My wife Malinda was very sick during June and July.

Snow stood as mouthpiece. His blessing was to receive the high priesthood and receive a father&#8217;s blessing to live to be a man and be obedient, to travel from land to land, from sea to sea, and gather scattered Israel home, of health and strength and long life. He was named Marion Edgar.</p>

<h3 id='thirtyfirst_december_1859'>Thirty-first December, 1859</h3>

<p>Theatre opened and the play, &#8220;ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS&#8221; was performed. I took the part of Toby Twinkle. This play was followed by a kind of long farce entitled &#8220;SEEING FOREIGN CURIOSITY.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hired two hands to got out posts for me. About this time my son Walaskia pulled a coffee pot which was full of boiling water and scaled himself very bad. The scald was from his right knee down to his ankle.</p>

<p>A great many cattle died during the winter. I bought fifty acres of land from Brother Peacock. It is bottom land. I gave one yoke of seven-year old cattle for having about eleven acres of land broke, as it was very soggy. I put it in Oats and I put three and one-half acres on the same piece. I also put in about eighteen acres of wheat on Brigham&#8217;s rand, one and one-half acres of potatoes, one-eighth of an acre of beets and one-fourth of an acre of corn. Raised nearly one-hundred-eighty bushels of wheat and about fifty or sixth bushel of oats, and eighteen bushels of potatoes.</p>

<p>I quit making whiskey during July or August, then Elizabeth, my wife, went on a visit to her father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s in Grantsville, Tooele Valley, and stayed all summer. I was afflicted with five boils under my left arm the part of the summer. I could not hire hands for harvesting, and I had to cut part of it myself. My arm was very sore during harvesting. I had some cut with the reaping machine.</p>

<p>My son, Marion Edgar fell very sick and also my wife, Malinda, while I was over to Grantsville fetching my wife, Elizabeth. Marion died on the Thirtieth of October 1860 at five P.M. of inflammation of the bowels. I felt the loss very much as I was very much attached to him.</p>

<p>Malinda still very sick of palpitation of the heart. She began to get better and seemed pretty well again until about Christmas, when she went to the theatre , and there she got pressed pretty hard and got sick again.</p>

<h3 id='twentyfifth_january_1861'>Twenty-fifth January 1861</h3>

<p>I was chosen as a school director from the First Ward of Manti City, also to assess the ward for a school room. At our general election in this place in February I was choses and elected to the office of fourth alderman.</p>

<p>My wife, Malinda, was sick during the spring with a cough and a pain in her chest, and her water affected and palpitation of the heart. Sometimes she seemed as if she were getting better. On the thirteenth of April I went to bed about nine o&#8217;clock and big her goodnight as usual. She coughed and scolded the children for being cross while I was reading the Deseret News. She had during the day to walk up as far as Brother Hall&#8217;s. On Monday the fifteenth. Elizabeth, my wife, was up on the Thirteenth at night until about twelve o&#8217;clock, and when she went to bed Malinda seemed to be asleep, having turned oer in bed about a half hour before Elizabeth retired. On the Fourteenth, which was Sunday, I got up about a half hour before sunrise and went into Malinda&#8217;s room, as I generally did during her sickness to see how she was, even before I had dressed myself. When I saw her, lo she was dead. I went and felt her pulse, but she was gone.</p>

<p>I was perfectly struck as I had no anticipation of anything of the kind. I ran in Elizabeth&#8217;s room and told her what was up. She jumped up instantly and when she saw her she burst into a flood of tears and wept bitterly. I went up to Sister Hall&#8217;s and asked her to come and attend her, and I sent my son, Walter, up to Alice Laza (Alice Hardman) a second cousin of mine, to come down. I went up to the store and bought some bleached calico to make her shroud or Temple clothes. I got Sister Lanza&#8217;s Temple apron with a promise to give her another in return, as I had not any at the time.</p>

<p>I thought to have kept her until Monday the fifteenth, but she began to mortify about ten o&#8217;clock the same day. Although she kept warm for about four hours after I had found her dead. In fact, she kept warm and looked so pleasant that I couldn&#8217;t realize she was dead until she began to mortify. She commenced getting cold at her head first, and she gradually went cold downward. Her stomach was warm to the last. I buried her at four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The choir attended and sang &#8220;WHY SHOULD WE MOURN FOR DYING FRIENDS&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>At this time I feel her loss very much and wish I was through with my work, so I could join her in a better world, for she was a good mother and a kind wife, clean and industrious. In fact, I feel that there never was a better woman lived on earth than she was. She was the mother of six children, all sons. At this time two dead and four living. She had no relations in the Valley but myself at the time of her decease. Elizabeth was a good wife and I believe will make a kind mother for Malinda&#8217;s children. I had cast an astrological figure for Malinda in the middle of March and found that nothing but the Priesthood could save her. I had her often administered to. She had been anointed and blessed and I firmly believed that she had gotten over the worst, but I was disappointed and I feel her loss. I feel to do as near right as my nature will admit and to try and overcome my follies and imperfections by the help of my Father in Heaven.</p>

<h3 id='fourth_may'>Fourth May</h3>

<p>I attended the City Council. I declared a certain pigpen that was on a sidewalk close by the North Fort Gate, a public nuisance. It belonged to Walter Cox. It was just no fit and condemned in the city council, as he had to move it. On the Tuesday following the City Council appointed me City Assessor and collector for Manti. I feel weak at present and a pain in my chest and lungs.</p>

<p>I baptized three of my sons, Ethelbert Hewitt, eleven years old last Third of October; Walter Kilshaw Hewitt, nine years old last Sixth of February; and James Arthur Barton eight years old the Thirteenth of last April. Ethelbert was confirmed the same day by Elder Walter F. Cox.</p>

<p>His blessing is to have the good spirit to guide his feet, and to keep him in the path of duty through life, to be a blessing to those around him, and to have all his heart&#8217;s desires is righteousness, etc. Walter Kilshaw was confirmed by Anfrew A. Mofatt, Bishop of this place. His blessing was similar to that of Ethelbert&#8217;s. James Arthur was confirmed by Walter F. Cox. His blessing was that he should receive the Priesthood and preach to the nations of the earth, and do much good and bocme a great and mighty man in Israel. Was to stand alone and clear his skirts of the nations of the earth and receive the blessing of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob etc.</p>

<h3 id='second_september_1862'>Second September 1862</h3>

<p>I was fetching a load of oats from the North Old Field. Had a large heavy wagon and a pretty large load. Got stuck or stalled in a deep gully and in trying to get out, had Walter and George Raphael catching the fore wheels. After considerable work the cattle started the load and George Raphael could not get out of the road in time, and the hind wheel ran over his groin and back and bruised his leg, but broke no bones as I could perceive, for which I feel to thank God. I brought him home on the wagon and rubbed him with whiskey and put ault bran paper on his bruises, which seemed to do him good.</p>

<p>During 1863 Brother Cook preferred a charge against me for un-Christianlike conduct because I tried to get his daughter for wife. The circumstances is like this. I felt some time in the fall of 1861 that his daughter Ann had a preference for me. I judged it by her actions. So I spoke to her and asked her if she had any objections to keep my company, provided her father would give his consent. She answered me that she would be very glad, so I spoke to her father before seeing her to speak to her and he answered that he would consider it.</p>

<p>I saw her about six months after seeing her father and asked her if her father had spoken to her about keeping me company. She said he had and had refused, so time passed on and I did not speak to her on the subject for some eight on ten months.</p>

<p>I went on the road west to Antelope Springs with a load of oats to fill Brother Brigham&#8217;s contract in the fall of 1862. January First the choir had a party which was held at Brother Hall&#8217;s house. Knowing of the party beforehand and our Bishop (A. T. Moffatt) came to me to inquire for all the names belonging to the choir. I gave him the names of all except Ann and one more which I did not think of at the time of his inquiry. When I thought of the two I had missed I concluded I would see her father, so I went and spoke to him in the presence of John Crawford. I told him that our Bishop had asked for all the names of those that belonged to the choir, and as I did not wish to give Ann&#8217;s name without his consent as I could not tell whether she and he considered her belonging to the choir or not, as she sometimes came to our practice meetings (and I knowing as also the whole of the members that she did not like her father to know that she attended) so I asked him if he had any objections for her to belong to the choir. He said he had not provided she kept good hours, but finally considered that he would think the matter over. So I never spoke to him on the subject after.</p>

<p>The choir held their party at Hall&#8217;s and she attended. I did not speak to her, neither did I request any other to invite her to come. I afterwards found out that Robert Braithwaite, one of the Choir members had asked her. While eating supper two of the party told me that Ann was hurt at something and she would not come to supper. They had tried to find out what was the matter and get her to associate with us.</p>

<p>So I went in the room where she was. The room was a small bedroom that joined the room that we were eating supper in a perfectly open and no door between the rooms. I asked her what was the matter, who she was vexed at, or what had displeased her.</p>

<p>My ninth son was born January twenty-ninth 1864 - seven hours and fifty-five minutes (evening). He is the son of my wife Elizabeth. He was blessed by Brother Robert Logan (High Priest) on the Fifth day of June 1864. He was named Thomas Quirk Barton. Was to go to the nations of the earth, to eat his bread among many people and visit many nations in diverse journeys. He was to enjoy health and strength, to have the Holy Priesthood as he held before he came here on earth, and become a might man and be an honor to his parents.</p>

<p>Ann&#8217;s marriage. On the tenth day of October 1864, I took to myself another wife. Her maiden name was Ann Cook, after having considerable trouble. But I was her choice and Brother Brigham Young told her and her father in the presence of many witnesses in Bishop Andrew A. Moffatt&#8217;s house that she had that right (the right of choice). In September 1864 she received her endowments and was married and sealed to me same date by Elder Wilford Woodruff, one of the Twelve Apostles. Winter of 1864 and 1865 I was called to visit many sick, a great many being sick (measles generally).</p>

<h2 id='1865'>1865.</h2>

<p>George A. Smith, Franklin D. Richards and Orson Hyde of the Twelve Apostles and others of the first President of Seventies in February visited Manti, Fort Gunnison and other places in Sanpete County. Their preaching was the principle of union one with another and for brothers not to go to law with brothers. Winter very cold and a great deal of snow and very long.</p>

<h3 id='july_eighteenth_'>July eighteenth -</h3>

<p>I was called to take a company of men as far as Salina to wait further orders on account of Indians. Moved from Salina on the Twentieth and traveled over the mountains up Twelve Mile Creek through Castle Valley and went as far as Green River. General Snow commanding and he appointed me his aide and agent for the trip and also general commissary. Company was without provisions for three days. Returned home on the Third day of August 1865.</p>

<p>Clara Ann, my daughter and Thomas Quirk Barton, my son, were sick on my return. Thomas got worse and on the Sixth day of August 1865, about two o&#8217;clock on Sunday he departed this life. His sickness was fever and died in convulsions (fits). Was buried on the Seventh day of August 1865 in the same grave as his sister Mary was laid in Manti City Burying Grounds.</p>

<p>Franklin, my son by Elizabeth, was born on the Nineteenth of December 1865 twelve thirty noon. Twenty-first of February my son Franklin took sick with fever and kept getting worse during the week. Inflammation set in on his lungs about the Twenty-fourth and his throat commenced swelling. The glands of his ears also. The disease looked something like scarlet fever. Could get no passage from him and he was delerious. I administered to him several times, but seemingly without effect. On Sunday February the Twenty-eighth he died about nineteen minutes past Seven A. M. Buried him same day at Five P.M.</p>

<p>Alpha, my son, by Ann, my third wife, took sick February Twenty-seventh, 1869. Commenced by having fits and then a high fever, ulcerated lungs and a swelling of the glands under the ears. On the Fourth of March I called the Bishop (Andrew Moffatt), Walter Cox and Brother Whoreham to administer and lay on their hand, which they did. He commenced to get better instantly, wanted to play as quick as the Elders left the house, but was too weak. March Tenth, nine A.M. Elizabeth Francis, my daughter by Ann, took suddenly sick. She had four fits during the day. I put a blister on the back of her neck towards evening and she had no more fits. We bathed her feet and legs in warm water several times. Got worse with an inward fever. Had to watch her during the night. Eleventh, still worse - difficult breathing. She died March Fourteenth 1869. (Elizabeth Francis).</p>

<p>During the early part of 1870 I was out helping E. W. Fox survey the county of Sanpete, so we could purchase from government fund, but very few government stakes as they had been destroyed. Took the field notes and plotted the survey. Heard by a man that Brother Shenton had died twelve years ago in drink.</p>

<p>Myself and my sons Ethelbert, Walter and James started for Salt Lake to get work as we had become very destitute of a great many comforts and necessities of life in consequence of the Indian War and grasshoppers destroying our crops. Walter in company with John Tatten got a job teaming in Cottonwood Canyon, hauling ore. Worked pretty much all summer. Hauled some wood to the city. James got a job teaming for N. Tanner, but did not seem to earn much. Had a great many breakdowns with my wagon.</p>

<p>Myself and son (Ethelbert) did some work whitewashing and painted for J. C. Little, and then we got in to work at Co-op Wagon Shop at painting Self at three dollars per day; son at one dollar. Continued in shop until beginning of November. We had a difficult job to get our pay. Left Co-op and got a job at Townsend Hotel, whitewashing, and did a few other jobs and left Salt Lake on the Thirteenth day of December.</p>

<p>Walter and James stayed and teamed for Tanner and other in Cottonwood. Was to have gotten twenty-five dollars per month. I had to take a light wagon from Co-op towards my pay for One-hundred-eighty dollars. Traded it for a Florence sewing machine, paying One-hundred-six dollars and got seventy-five dollars in cash for wagon. Bought some paint to take home. Spent all the money I had but two dollars.</p>

<p>Arrived home on the eighteenth and was glad. There seems to be no place like home. My wife Ann was down to the city with us about three months the first part of the season. Her son Alpha got hurt by a gate falling in him, so she returned home. After two or three weeks Elizabeth (my wife) was down to the city and stayed until we returned home. Snow on the ground and very cold.</p>

<p>Self and son got several small jobs of painting during winter. I did some plotting for the County Court. Paid my taxes and got wheat to do us until March or April. Had a settlement with the tithing. Got some credit for hauling rock for a new meeting house. Had pleasant winter. Brothers and neighbors glad to see me. Grass hoppers had laid their eggs during the fall of 1870. consequently I had little hopes of raising much grain. Fences very poor and not union enough to get any better fences.</p>

<p>Planted five acres of potatoes, one of oats, and two acres of peas and four acres and corn. My potatoes were nearly all destroyed, only getting thirty-five bushels. Should have had about five-hundred bushels, but cattle destroyed crop in consequence of poor fence. Raised forty bushels of oats, thirty bushels of corn and fourteen bushels of peas on my two city blocks.</p>

<p>Left home on the First of March for the city of Salt Lake. Took my won team and Ethelbert and Raphael. I called at Cottonwood Canyon to see the boys I had left. Found James late at night and I learned that Walter was in the City trying to get his pay for him and James for their winter&#8217;s work. I conclude that from that time I would try and keep my sons with me and try and give them a trade so they could earn a living anywhere. Trade seemed to be brisk in the City.</p>

<p>I took several jobs of plastering. James and Walter lathed up and plastered along with me. I then hired James out to learn plastering at two dollars per day. Walter, Ethelbert and myself worked at whitewashing and painting. Got all the work we possibly could do all summer. James after three months hire, went in partners with an old man at plastering and averaged from three to three and one half dollars per day. I rented two rooms from Brother W. Cahoon Twelfth Ward for seven dollars per month. Could not agree with him. He seemed to have but little reason in him.</p>

<h2 id='1871__birth_of_daughter_lilly_may'>1871 - BIRTH OF DAUGHTER LILLY MAY</h2>

<p>After we had been up to the City three months, having no one to keep house but my oldest daughter living, which was eleven years old. My wife Elizabeth arrived, having had to stay in Manti in consequence of my wife Ann being confined. She was confined the Twenty-seventh day of April between two and three o&#8217;clock and brought forth a daughter. She was named and blessed on the Sixth day of July by Brothers James Crawford and Warren P. Snow, naming her Lilly May Cook Barton. I was prospered much during the year. I realized that most every one was after the almighty dollar, both saints and gentiles.</p>

<p>A bitter persecution was raised against the Saints. Considerable numbers of mines were opened and made business very brisk. First case of polygamy in, as the case was stated for adultery (Hawkins defendant and his first wife, plaintiff). He was convicted and sentenced to three years in the penitentiary and five-hundred dollar fine by a damned scoundrel by the name of McKean. So far as I could learn the jury was packed with men determined to convict, guilty or not. Judge over-ruling every time in favor of Plaintiff. Judge said when sentencing him, he was sorry, very sorry, but he did not extend any mercy, but was very bitter and vindictive. Several others were indicted for similar cause and some of my brothers were indicted for murder. President Brigham Young, Richard Wells, Hosea Stout, William Kimball, Burt Hampton, Toms and some others. I read several editorials and pieces that are published in California and several other states in the Union, also in London, Sheffield and other places in England, demanding the proceedings of McKean&#8217;s tyrannical Court of Justice and of government not taking steps to stop such doings.</p>

<h2 id='1871__working_to_salt_lake_city'>1871 - WORKING TO SALT LAKE CITY</h2>

<p>I was present when the marshall <a href='Patrick'>United States Marshall</a> was taking Brother Wells to a military camp, and I really felt bad and would have been willing to have had the last drop of bleed I had spilt or shed to have him delivered from his enemies if it had been wisdom or required. (Brother Wells was afterwards allowed bail five thousand dollars, to appear in March term of 1872. the others were still kept in confinement with the exception of Brigham Young who had gone south before the warrant had been issued.</p>

<p>NB During the winter of 18770 and 1871 I was engaged in several debates and gave a lecture of astronomy and many of its absurdities, which was noticed in The Deseret News. Debates and lectures were given in the Court House, I holding the office of First Director for the Manti Library Association.</p>

<p>Self and boys had constant work all summer and I was able to provide my family with many comforts. I gave my boys five dollars per week for spending money an encouragement and advised them to spend it in something useful, with they generally observed. Ethelbert came to age (twenty-one years) on the Third of October. I gave them a party afterwards I gave Ethelbert five dollars per week and he agreed to stay with me another year and try and finish his trade (painting).</p>

<p>I bought a very fine organ, made my Mason and Harlen (five octave) which cost two-hundred dollars, and hired a music teacher, a Mr. Cook and I took considerable pains myself to teach my daughter Malinda Jane. I think she progressed very well. I also bought a carpet (three ply) cost for twenty-two yards, forty-four dollars, a large looking glass (six dollars, seventy-five cents) four large Cromeal&#8217;s pictures (fifty dollars) and several other things which make up pretty comfortable at home. Myself and Elizabeth left for home on the Fourteenth of November. Arrived home on the Nineteenth. Some snow and rain. Roads bad.</p>

<h2 id='winter_1871_and_1872__building'>WINTER 1871 AND 1872 - BUILDING</h2>

<p>My three boys did not leave the city until about a month afterwards, having plenty of work. I sent two boys down to the City and two teams expecting John Wilson to return in company with my boys, but he backed out, so my boys fetched Sister Wilson (his mother) and sister Cason Cahoon. During the last of December and through January and February we laid a good many rocks, about one hundred-fifty perch of rock in a building I had laid out during last winter. Size of building is sixty-six by fifty feet, designed for a dwelling house and a social hall, foundation three feet walls, above foundation two feet thick, the lower part partitions as for workshop, granary, paint shop, dining room thirty-four by eighteen feet, a hall running east and was seven feet wide and two bed rooms eighteen by twenty feet (on ground floor) upper part all in one for a hall for dancing and for a theatre. If Manti should become thickly settled and be a business City. I can partition this upper story off and open a hotel.</p>

<p>Our library well attended. Our co-operation store doing a good business. Dividends struck first at January giving four and thirty-one hundreths per share of ten dollars for six months. I think their percent too much, it being thirty percent charge on all good sold (making the poor poorer and the rich richer, which was not designed in the first place in the Co-op principle). First Sunday after my return I was called to act as superintendent of our Sunday School, which position I held before I left in the Spring last. I got up three balls (dances) for the benefit of our Sunday School realizing from the first - eighteen dollars; the second three dollars. The third I got up and superintended myself. Took my organ and had my daughter play on it during the evening at intervals and I sang about eight different songs, accompanied by organ. Gave good satisfaction. Gave a supper to all who wished, charging sixty-to cents per head. Lost some on supper, but realized some twelve dollars clear after paying for fiddlers and other expenses. I charged nothing for my services.</p>

<p>My design in taking the organ was to create a feeling for such music with the public, thinking we might co-operate together and get one for our meetinghouse for public worship, but no steps have been taken since to do anything. It looks to me like there is a general lack of public interest. Our school (Sunday) is better attended than ever before, being induced by presents of merits etc. but we lack male teachers. Sunday February Eighteenth about two-hundred-thirty-seven scholars.</p>

<p>February - I was elected as first school trustee for Manti district. We have only one school house in Manti and that not finished. We lack benches (or seats) desks, maps, and many things for our youths, but above all, an interest for our youth&#8217;s interest. A caucus meeting was called to consider out common range for cows, and now many brethren have been in the habit of taking up our public land for hay meadows and for farming it and selling it, and are not willing that our youth that are grown up men in our midst shall take any for their own use, thereby discouraging them, making them seek other homes elsewhere, which has a tendency to break up homes.</p>

<h1 id='school'>SCHOOL</h1>

<p>Both of my mule teams made a trip to Pioche mines with salt, flour, oats, and potatoes. Made clear of all expenses about fifty dollars. Was away twenty-five days. Started again in February, one team joined with John Crawford loaded with eggs, butter, potatoes and flour. The other team started twenty-third of February with barley (freight) for B. Spencer. Walter and Raphael, my boys, driving teams both times.</p>

<p>All of boys (mine) studying at nights all winter. James and Ethelbert going to John Bench&#8217;s night school, studying bookkeeping. They seem to be giving their mind to study this winter, which pleases we very much. I expect much trouble from Uncle Sam in March and June next to Saints in Utah because of the planets influence (say last day of March or First of April and about the Fourth of June)</p>

<p>A remarkable open winter with a good deal of snow falling in the mountains. Ann, my wife, having very poor health all winter. My health improving. Boys all well, only James, and he is troubled with boils on his neck and groin.</p>

<p>I finished paying Abraham Washburn to the amount of sixty-seven dollars and fifty cents for one hay lot situated below the Middle Field and bottoms of West lane containing nearly five acres (about the Fifteenth of March). March Twenty-fifth while I was cutting rock for an arch for the blacksmith shop at about twenty minutes past eight A.M. I was struck with a sever pain in my right kidney so that I could not move but had to be put to bed.</p>

<p>At Twenty-eight minutes past eight in the evening my wife Elizabeth, was delivered of a fine girl weighing eleven pounds. She had considerable pain and vomited after her delivery. I managed to get up from my bed and administered to her. She fainted, but while my hands were on her head she recovered. I sent for Brother Logan to come and he administered to her twice and after that she seemed to rest much better.</p>

<p>On the Twenty-seventh of March my boys finished putting in of twenty-nine acres of wheat. On the Twenty-eighth Ethelbert, my son, sowed ten acres of oats, bottom of Old Field. I am still sick and not able to do anything. Scarcely able to sit up, but hope soon to be better.</p>

<p>On the Ninth day of April four o&#8217;clock afternoon myself and my son, James Arthur went down in the Old Field to get some willows for the purpose of fencing in my chickens. James saw a goodly number of cranes close by where my sons Ethelbert, Walter, and Raphael and John Henry were working, putting in oats. James went to the wagon, got my double barreled shot-gun, which was loaded at the time, pretty heavy, and made towards the cranes, having to creep on his hands and knees on purpose to get close to them.</p>

<p>He got in ditch fence and near enough to kill as he thought. He took aim and fired, but the gun burst, breaking apart both barrels, bursting one barrel close to the breach about seven inches long, splintering and breaking up the stock in pieces. I found on the morning after ninety-two pieces of the stock. John Henry found one large piece of stock. The butt and the other I found twenty-three feet north east, the lock thirty-three feet east, the breech thirty feet northeast, the breach pin thirty-one feet south east, one piece of stock forty-one feet southeast, and one piece twenty seven feet south west. The other pieces seemed to be scattered to the rear and to the right and left of where the he fired the gun. I heard the gun very plainly and looked to see if he had killed any of them.</p>

<h2 id='1872__april__james_is_hurt__sickness'>1872 - APRIL - JAMES IS HURT - SICKNESS</h2>

<p>But, alas, I suspicioned something was wrong for the boy acted as if he was hurt. I incidentally set off on a run toward him. When I got up to where he was, he having come about about a one-quarter of a mile, and I having traveled about the same distance after I suspected he was hurt. I found him crying and in much pain, having shot his left hand. The barrel or stock had torn away flesh from the thumb running from his wrist to his first finger and about three inches wide on the inside of his hand. His third finger was partly blown off, almost up to its second joint.</p>

<p>In a few minutes my team arrived as I had already called for the boys to make haste. We went home. I sent and got a bottle of Port wine as he had lost a great deal of blood. I dressed his hand, cutting some loose flesh off and I also cut off the bone at his finger up to the first joint and one half of the bone next to the second joint. I got some silk and sewed the flesh running from the palm of his hand to his thumb as close as I could close it. Then I wrapped it up with strips of cloth after I had washed it as clean as I could with soap and water.</p>

<p>During the dressing my son, Ethelbert, fainted twice. On the fourteenth of April in dressing his hand I found two small pieces of the gun stock in his hand. I dressed it every morning with salve and it seems to be doing well. Elizabeth seems to be getting some better from her confinement, it being twenty days since her confinement, and the first day she put her clothes on.</p>

<p>Ann, my wife, seems pretty much worn out by care and work. I have not been able to do much work since the Twenty-fifth of March, not being well. My team finished putting in of twenty-eight acres of wheat and twenty acres of oats. Hauled a good many loads of manure on my city lots, pile up a considerable pile to rot in my stackyard. Got in fourteen rods of carrots and one and a half rods of onions. Grafted nineteen peach trees with choice peach cuttings. Fixed up considerable on my coral.</p>

<p>April Twelfth and Fourteenth about six inches of snow. On the night of April Twelfth it froze so my boys could walk across the creek and the ditch. Ice was about two inches thick and some more than that. Afterwards, it was fine weather, fine growing weather for wheat and oats. Snow and frost disappeared in the day. Out of hay and having to buy at eight dollars per ton, during the winter I have to buy my potatoes and wheat and oats, paying forty cents for potatoes and from one dollar to one-dollar and forty cents for wheat, from ninety cents to one dollar for oats, (for feed and for seed).</p>

<h2 id='1872__mission_to_england'>1872 - MISSION TO ENGLAND</h2>

<p>I was called at the October general conference October Ninth to go on a mission to Europe, but not learning or hearing from the Presidency, I did not start until Wednesday November Twentieth, when I started by mail for Salt Lake City. When I arrived at Salt Lake City I learned that they (Church authorities) did not design any other notice than that of publishing in the Deseret News.</p>

<p>November Twenty-second, I gave my genealogy to the Church Historian and was set apart for the mission by Brother Daniel H. Wells and George Q. Cannon (Danies H. Wells was second counselor to President Young). Brother Cannon, one of the Twelve Apostles. Got my certificate and license from Brother McKinza. President Brigham Young asked me how I liked being called on a mission. I told him it was all right with me. I was at his service to do as I might be told to do by the right authority.</p>

<p>He gave me a blessing that I should do goo and should be blessed, and whomsoever I should bless, they should be blessed. I left him with good feelings for he told me I should return home again well satisfied and a better man, praising God for all his mercies, etc.</p>

<p>/Some stuff crossed out/</p>

<p>showed a bad state of affairs. At night a few of the saints met in a social party. Had tea, sang hymn, other songs, told toasts, made jokes and played games and had a general good time and all seemed to enjoy a good spirit. Slept at Ford&#8217;s.</p>

I went to a Wax Works Show. I saw a large painting to represent Brigham and his forty-seven wives, some of them booting him and others weeping. He (Brigham) was represented as a very old man sitting in a chair, his mouth turned down at the corners - nothing like him. Got a Bible that I had bound. Cost 13/ Brother Harttle gave me 1/-</p>

I took dinner, attended afternoon meeting, bore my testimony and not feeling well I did not go out anywhere, although I had several invitations for tea. I spoke at night for fifty minutes and enjoyed a good flow of the Spiritv God and I felt the most humble I ever felt and the most dependent upon God for His aid. Felt better after meeting.

I stopped all night after I had been kindly and unexpectedly received. Did find that they had no inclination towards the Gospel of Christ on their part. Stopped all night with my cousin Elizabeth Duff.</p>

<h3 id='fifth_august__tuesday'>Fifth August - Tuesday</h3>

<p>On Tuesday Fifth of August I learned that my brother Stephen C. Barton was living in Preston so I took the train for Preston 1/4 and found my brother without much trouble, but in a deplorable condition in regards to morality, given to drink and swearing. He had been married for twenty years to an Irish woman by the name of Mary Swards. He was at this time in employment at Carder and had charge of the card room and of two other departments. Seemed to be a good mechanic and might do will if he would be sober. He had been to sea on a Man of War. He had been to China, to Russia, Persia, and all along the Mediterranean Sea, to France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Greece and to Canada.</p>

<p>He had been to New York several times and had followed the sea for fifteen years. He had forgotten God, his prayers, and never thought of asking the blessing on his food. He and his wife treated me very kindly and affectionately. I stopped in Preston two days and tried to find some of my own father&#8217;s sisters and brothers, but failed as they were all deceased but one. Saw the Old Cock Pitt where the first Mormon sermons were preached and where the first Latter-day Saints were made in England.</p>

<h3 id='seventh_august__1873__thursday'>Seventh August - 1873 - Thursday</h3>

<p>After receiving a beautiful handkerchief from my brother&#8217;s sister-in-law and getting a Promise from my brother that he would be a better man, or at least he would try to be one, and promising that he would try and see me off when I should get my release to return to Utah, we parted in tears, although I must say that I felt it as hard if not harder to part with my brethren in the Gospel as I did my brother in consequence of his not living as he should do. &#8220;My God, help him see his folly and repent and become a saint, and then my old love would cling to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I returned to Accrington 1/4. Attended the Accrington Fair and Feast and was much delighted to see so many children walk, there being about twelve hundred in the procession. Several bands of music were there and a great deal of interest seems to be taken in Sunday Schools by almost all classes of people. I tried to get my relatives to assemble all together, so that I could preach the Gospel and bear my testimony to them, but I failed to awaken an interest in the work of God, but hope some day that they will. I promised to write and they promised to write to me, and maybe I can touch them by letters and give them my testimony of the truth of the work of God in these last days.</p>

<p>On Friday the eighth of August I returned to Wakefield 3/62 and to Darton /7 1/2. Stopped all night at Brother Lawton&#8217;s and on Saturday the Ninth I walked to Barnsley taking with me a set of tea service that I had bought for Sister Bryon, she being in that line and I got them at cost. She made me a very nice present of a pair of Chimney Piece Ornaments worth five dollars. Took train to Woambwell 1/4 and called upon Brother I. Dale and Mr. Berry and induced them to promise to attend the Ratherhorn Meeting on Sunday, Tenth August which they did. Cost of fare from Woambwell to Sheffield 1/3. Received from Brother I. Dale two pounds, also his I.E.D. 2/8 1/2 for books the 2/8 1/2 I paid to Brother Perkin. Held meeting in the afternoon. Had a good time.</p>

<p>Cost to Ratherhorn -/4 at night. Returned to Sheffield and while at Ratherhorn I accompanied Brother Parkin and visited several of the brethren and received from Sister Ellen Lenion nineteen pounds on her I.E.D.</p>

<h3 id='eleventh_august__monday'>Eleventh August - Monday</h3>

<p>I sent to Liverpool by draft for A. Carrington 27.90. Paid for registering a letter /5 and for stamps /6. Visited Sister Boat, also another sister who was at variance. Tried to reconcile her but failed at time. I then took a train to Chesterfield 1/-. When I arrived I found that the Colliers of the district were holding a demonstration which was very large, about eleven thousand-five-hundred people formed in a procession. Had thirty-three bands.</p>

<p>On Tuesday August Twelfth after stopping at Brother Brailsford&#8217;s at Hasland, Brother Brailsford and Halseybrook accompanied me to Tupton and took dinner at Brother Job Stacy&#8217;s. Then we walked to Clay Cross. Called on Brother Creswell. Visited the Flower Show, which was a grand sight. Returned after seeing several sights including a Punch and Judy Show, Balloon Ascension, and best of all a man fish who performed in a large cistern of water with a glass front so all could see him. He ate biscuits while under water, smoked a pipe, and swam about just like a fish. He laid down at the bottom and would stay under water about one and one-half minutes and then would rise to the top and take fresh air. A wonderful sight.</p>

<p>Arrived at Hasland at ten-thirty at night. Did not stop to see fire works. Stopped all night at Brother Brailsford&#8217;s. On Wednesday Thirteenth I walked to Chesterfield. Visited the brethren and returned at night to Brother Brailsford&#8217;s.</p>

<h3 id='fourteenth_august__thursday'>Fourteenth August - Thursday.</h3>

<p>I walked to Chesterfield again. Took dinner with Brother Bingley and tea with Brother Turner. Brother Turner gave me 1/- so I gave the 1/- to his president with instructions to give it back to him as a help for the poor, but not to tell him who gave it. I was impressed while in Chesterfield to return to Sheffield, which I did and found letters from home and two from Liverpool which I answered. Attended the meeting which was poorly attended. Preached and had a good time and enjoyed a good spirit.</p>

<p>/page 34/ got homes or were taken south to other settlements.</p>

<p>Our luggage arrived at the Temple Block the day after we arrived and all the luggage was distributed to their owners. On Monday myself and part of my family started for Grantsville to see my wife&#8217;s father and mother. Stopped one day and on Wednesday we started for home, passing through Rush Valley, where our wagon wheel broke down. I fixed it up the best I could, and when we arrived at Camp Floyd we stopped at a brother&#8217;s house. Got breakfast and then started out again but found that the broken wheel would not see us home, so we returned to the brother&#8217;s house and he kindly loaned me the hind part of his wagon.</p>

<p>The next morning we started again all right. Arrived at Goshen Settlement late at night. Road had some snow on it. Stopped at a Brother Rud Edwards. The next day, at William Warwoods, Nephi. The next day we got to Moroni at dusk and there we met my son James and a fresh team. We got home about eleven P.M. on the Twenty-third of November (Sunday), just one year and three days since I left home to go on my mission.</p>

<p>The choir of Manti serenaded me the same night and sang some very appropriate songs. The next night they gave me a supper, which I and my family partook of at Brother John Crawford&#8217;s. The same night the brass band serenaded my house, all of which made me feel good and much honored.</p>

<p>On examination of my affairs and things, I found them in much disorder, wagons and all kinds of tools which I had left for my family&#8217;s use, broken and many things destroyed. On Sunday Thirtieth November I attended Sunday School and the Bishop gave out an appointment for me to speak on the Sunday following, which I did, and I was appointed as Superintendent of our Sunday School, which office I held before my leaving home.</p>

<p>A week or two after this time President Young with others visited Manti and gave us some very good instruction, and Brother Young gave me another Mission to travel and preach to the Saints in Sevier and Sanpete Counties, and to continue to preach until I should be released.</p>

<p>Was made one of the Committee on the new Meeting house, and worked on the same the Thirtieth of January 1875. Drew the plan and helped design it. My wife, Ann, was confined on Wednesday the Third of February 1875. It was a girl which we called Isabelle Cook Barton. In the fall of 1875 my sons plastered five rooms of my house and my son, Ethelbert and myself painted the same, which makes us very comfortable for the winter.</p>

<p>On the Twelfth of August 1875 at Eight A.M. being out of lye, and having no ashes leeched, my wife went over the road to our neighbors Tuttle and borrowed a tablespoonful, and placing it on the table, left it about a minute to do some chore, and my son got up on a chair and took the teacup and drank the lye, almost killing him. Administered to him. Gave him oil and vinegar afterwards, and he vomited.</p>

<h1 id='rods__gets_ten_thousand_feet_of_lumber'>RODS - GETS TEN THOUSAND FEET OF LUMBER</h1>

<p>Bought from Richard Hall in February a piece of land known as Hall Springs, situated a little northeast of Manti, consisting of about five acres, under a very poor fence, with a beautiful spring on it, enough to water about seven or eight acres. But I am in good hopes to be able to increase the water as it indicated it. Myself and wife moved to the Springs on the Twenty-fifth day of March into a one-room house built of rock, but a very poor one. We put on an addition of lumber to answer for the kitchen. Walaskia, my son, aged eighteen years, having gained in health was able to move with us. Also my son Stephen Cornel, aged six months. My daughter Malinda and Clara Ann also Salena, my daughter.</p>

<p>The same day we moved to the Springs, my son, Raphael started with a load of oak, barley, eggs, better, etc. for Pioche with four mules and a three-three-fourths bain wagon.</p>

<p>We took to the Springs seven cows and I bought fifty chickens, which we took after building a good corral and shed and an adobe chicken coop. We took up seventy-six acres of land, put up four hundred rods of fence five pails high during the summer. Part of it I had to hire, the boys putting up the remainder.</p>

<p>My sons set out three or four thousand poles from up Willow Creek, also some logs, which with what they got out during the winter of 1874 and 1875 made nearly ten thousand feet of good lumber. We raised some wheat, oats and barley about seven hundred bushels.</p>

<p>WORKING ON THE MEETING HOUSE - WORKING ON THE TITHING OFFICE - WALASKIA AND NICHOLAS HYRUM ORDAINED ELDERS.</p>

<p>We moved down to town on the last of October, after threshing time my sons Ethelbert, James and Walaskia painted the outside of the Manti Meeting House, also plastered the upstairs, painted the inside and out, and helped to build a theatrical stage. Myself painted the scenery also plastered partly the Tithing Office, built a chimney for the same, and drew the plans for the new office. Both jobs amounted to about four-hundred dollars. What what done on the Tithing Office was credited on tithing, about one-hundred dollars.</p>

<p>My son, Walaskia took sick again and had to leave work early in December 1875. He continued to grow worse, spitting blood and had a very bad cough and palpitation of the heart. Took to his bed the last of January 1876. I went down to Fort Ephraim on the Seventh of February for Dr. Higgins Davis. He came up with us, bringing his wife. It was good sleighing, plenty of snow. He said that there was no hopes for Walaskia&#8217;s recovery, but before I went for the doctor, the night he took sick, I called in the Elders, Brother Cox, Cook and Bishop A. J. Moffatt and had him, also my son, Hyrum administered to and anointed. Brother Cox confirmed and ordained Walaskia to the office of an Elder. Brother Cook blessed my son Hyrum, and Brother Cox ordained him an Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

<p>On the Eighth of February I called in Bishop J. B. Maiben and he annointed and blessed both of my sons that were sick. Prayed God to spare their lives, but in none of their blessings did the Elders promise life. On the Ninth of February at one o&#8217;clock A.M. Walaskia died. After begging me to let him go. His mother had called for him and had asked him to leave this world, but my son said he didn&#8217;t want to go. This was about ten P.M. but about three or four minutes before he died he said, &#8220;Oh, Father let me go&#8221; I told him I would not hold him, and I told the Lord to take him. The boy clasped his hands together and died without another struggle. We buried him, leaving our house at three-thirty P.M. for the burying ground. This makes my sixth child and one wife that I have buried. It is hard to part with those we love, but it is not for me to have my will, but it is God&#8217;s good pleasure. He gave and he taketh away. During January and February and the early part of March, my son, James Arthur and myself finished up and cut out some very handsome gravestones and a beautiful monument. The monument worth one-hundred and fifty dollars. The grave stone from seventy-five dollars down to ten dollars when lettered. John Henry and Ethelbert, huring the same time were quarrying out rock.</p>

<h2 id='1876'>1876</h2>

<p>During January and February my sons James and Ethelbert took great interest and seemed to be very anxious to help me got along and get out of debt. I painted a sign for Dr. Higgins Davis and made him a present of some flour, potatoes, pork a little Coal Oil, and some tea, for he seemed a good man, but very poor. He was very thankful and blessed me and my wife for it.</p>

<p>James and John Henry left home for Leeds, the Dixie Mine the Sixth at seven A.M. of December. I have not associated in company but very little since my return from my mission. Nor public meeting during 1875, 1876 and 1877. The cause, embarrassment of my own affairs and an eternal call, at all our meetings, for donations. My son, Hyrum, who has been sick so long, began to get better, having kept more or less down since my son Walaskia&#8217;s death, and now on October Twenty-fifth he kept some bread down for the first time.</p>

<p>April first my daughter Malinda Jayne was married, myself officiating as minister. To Joseph James Taylor, second son of President John Taylor and was sealed for all time and eternity in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City, on the Eighth of April 1880.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1880, my son, George R. Barton was kicked in the face by one of his horses. Face and head badly bruised. Was laid up several weeks in Pioche, Nevada, where he was working and keeping store. Soon after, my son, Alexander, while on the road to Silver Reef was run over by a wagon and on his return was run over again, which made him lame for a long time.</p>

<p>Just before Christmas my son James Arthur, while hauling wood down at Silver Reef was kicked in the face by one of his mares, cutting a gash through his nose and lower lip.</p>

<p>My son, Nicholas Hyrum Cook Barton took seriously sick on the Twenty-third day of July 1880 and from then until July Thirtieth could not keep anything don his stomach in consequence of the lye he took in the summer of 1875. We had him administered to by Elder Andrew J. Moffatt on Sunday July Twenty-fifth. And also by Brother James Wareham. On Thursday July Twenty-ninth I had administered to him twice during his sickness, but the spirit forbade him being healed. On Friday the Thirtieth I consecrated him and dedicated him unto the Lord at Twelve o&#8217;clock. His spirit left him at twenty minutes past noon. Buried him on Sunday, August First, at Three P.M. February Eighteenth, 1881, Ann Cook Barton gave birth to a girl at one - forty-nine P.M. We named her Emily Amelia Cook Barton.</p>

<p>January Thirty-first. Attended an appointed meeting of Committee to award and grant and to deed lots in our Manti burying grounds. Myself and boys having put in forty-four parcels of stone wall somewhere about the year of 1864, 1865 or 1866. I was awarded two full lots Number One and Two, Block Fourteen being in size Sixteen by Twenty-four feet, but could not get a deed as yet. The parcel of burying ground known as the old burying ground is now in the hands of Lottie Barton, the late Lottie Young.</p>

<p>March Fourth. G. R. Barton, his wife and two children, also my two sons James Arthur and Alex Barton returned from the Pennsylvania District Mines, G. R. Barton having failed in the mining enterprise.</p>

<p>March Sixteenth being my birthday, G. R. Barton started from home at about Five A.M. for Colorado to see what openings, if any, could be found to make a fresh start. As it were in life, my health is still very poor. I can scarcely breathe. My lungs seemed to be filled with phlegm. Nearly all of the air cells seem to be filled, leaving no room for my breath. I feel very bad, business very dull. Alex and Alpha busy putting in my spring crops. April Second, Josephine Barton, wife of my son, G. R. Barton gave birth to a fine son at Two O&#8217;clock A.M., Saturday, April Seventh, Ann Cook Barton&#8217;s child was blessed by Brother J. be. Maiben, President&#8217;s Couselor, Stake of Sanpete, and gave it the name of Edward Barton.</p>

<p>************************************ President John Taylor</p>

<p>Dear Brother,</p>

<p>Believing in the maxim (It is better to represent ourselves than be represented by others) I take this opportunity - having as I thought a fair understanding with Brother Fulsom as in regards the springs or spring water that has been contemplated for the Manti Temple. I find now that he (Fulsom) according to what he said yesterday in our trying to arrange a settlement of the springs, and we not agreeing that he was determined not to understand me, but would represent you that I was not a man of my word and that I could not be depended upon. If so, it is the first time and he the first person to find out. But the matter stands thus and you can judge for yourself. That the Temple could have the Spring water, a part or whole by replacing the same amount from our City Creek during irrigating time, or that the Temple could have from the springs all that would be necessary for ceremonial purposes free of cost or replacement, and that the right of the same be guaranteed unto the Church - but that in case they have to have more water than for ceremonial purposes (for irrigation etc.) and the same could not be replaced and there would not be sufficient water left to justify me in retaining my farm and improvement.</p>

<p>This letter was written to President John Taylor from Grandfather William Kilshaw Barton concerning the Temple Springs water which grandfather owned. This letter had no date, but was recorded in his history or diary. The page containing the rest of the letter was torn out, so what it contained is not available.</p>

<p>I copied this letter from the original diary on Wednesday February 1966</p>

<h2 id='life_of_william_kilshaw_barton'>LIFE of WILLIAM KILSHAW BARTON</h2>

<p>by</p>

<h2 id='clinton_william_barton__grandson'>Clinton William Barton ## Grandson</h2>

<p>My father, Stephen Cornel Barton, pointed out to me a few interesting points concerning my grandfather. Father told me that Grandfather was a very talented man. He was a jack of all trades in a sense. He carved his own grave stone and it was a very excellent piece of work. At the top of the heavy stone a lamb was carved out. It was a very fine replica. I saw this grave stone before it was replaced, and the lamb and engraving was as perfect as any I have ever seen. Whatever he did, he did well. He seemed to be able to do any kind of work well.</p>

<p>Grandfather was a student of astrology. He either knew more about the subject than any man I know of, or else he entertained some ideas that today - 1966 would be considered unorthodox or unacceptable. Father Abraham seemed to have a great knowledge of the stars and I suspect that no living man knows all there is to know about them. However, and in spite of what others may think or say, this story came down to me from my own father. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother, James, lost a span of very fine mules. He hunted several days for them, but to no avail. Those mules seemed to have vanished. So James came to his father and told him of the loss of his mules. My Grandfather is reported to have said, &#8216;Come back in the morning. I may have some information that will help you.&#8217; Then as night settled, my Grandfather took his priceless telescope out under the stars. He studied the heavenly bodies most of the night and wrote down his findings.</p>

<p>The next morning James returned to receive the help he expected from his father. Grandfather said, &#8216;James, ride out towards the resevoir. When you get a little beyond the brick yard turn down the lane to the right, the first lane. You will meet a man on top of a load of hay. Ask him if he has seen your bay mules and he will tell you where they are.&#8217;</p>

<p>James did as he was told, and when he halted the man riding on the top of the load of hay, he asked the man if he had seen a span of bay mules. The man said, &#8216;Why yes, I saw a span of mules right back there,&#8217; and he pointed towards a willow patch. &#8216;The mules are lying down just the other side of those willows.&#8217; James rode through the field and as the man said, there were the mules.&#8221;</p>

<p>This story seems too unreasonable to accept as fact, but this is the story my own father told me, and he seemed to be very sincere about the whole matter. Grandfather believed that the heavenly bodies exercised some kind of mystic control over man on earth. He often spent hours out under the stars with his telescope. He speaks of charting some person&#8217;s life in the diary which he wrote.</p>

<p>Grandfather could do well about anything he put his hands to. He was gifted in music. At one time he operated a store. One of my cousins reported to me that her mother said that he would have his boys dig a hole and then fill it up again rather than be idle. He believed that success was the end result of hard work.</p>

<p>One day I asked my father a real tough question. I said, &#8220;Father, you were reared in polygamy. Tell me, father, did the wives fight and quarrel a lot or did they get along fairly well?&#8221; My father stroked his chin for sometime while his mind spanned the years and examined anew the facts. He was or seemed lost in thought for sometime before he answered. Then he replied, &#8220;Son, I have never been asked that question before in my life, and now that I reflect and think of it, I can truthfully say that I have never heard my mother and the other wife, Ann, ever exchange a single cross word..</p>

<p>They would sit and quilt, or sew, or darn socks, and they seemed happy. They would often laugh together and have such a good time. They would talk over problems of their children, and seemed to love each other and enjoy each other very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>My father was an honest man. I have never known him to lie about anything. I believe that my grandfather&#8217;s wives got along well. I feel certain they did not try to solve their problems of their day and time, by quarreling and fussing. I am certain that if contention was within the fabric of their lives, my father would have remembered at least one glaring incident.</p>

<p>My father told me that grandfather believed in the principle of plurality and that he tried hard to make it work as it was intended. The women knew of the law. They did not go into it blind, and they seemed to be determined to live sensibly enough to prove the plan would work. I am proud of my grandparents. They must have been fine persons.</p>

<h2 id='new_entry__10_october_1968__clinton_william_barton_says'>New entry - 10 October 1968 - Clinton William Barton says:</h2>

<p>&#8220;A few days ago I was down in Monticello, Utah. I had a very fine visit with A.B. Barton and his good wife. He is the son of Ethelbert Hewitt Barton, second son of William Kilshaw Barton and his first wife, Melinda Jane Hewitt.</p>

<p>I asked this very fine old gentleman, who is past eighty years of age, if he had ever heard their father (Ethelbert) say anything about the problems of plural marriage. He answered promptly, &#8220;I have talked with my father about how his first wife, Melinda Jane Hewitt, and his second wife, Elizabeth Frances Quirk, got along with each other, and how grandfather got along with his first two wives. He said, &#8220;Those wives were wonderful to each other. They loved each other and each loved the children of the other as much at they did their own. Grandfather got along with both wives. I never remember of hearing a quarrel among them.</p>

<p>These facts give me more and more love and respect for my talented Grandfather, William Kilshaw Barton, and all three of his wonderful wives. It appears that some men and women in polygamy were big enough to make a success of it.</p>
