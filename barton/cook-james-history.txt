# James Cook History

James was born in Newport Shropshire England in 1816 and married Ann Lane at
Wolverhampton, Staffordshire England in 1843. When he was 27 and she was 24.
Ann was born in Brewood, Staffordshire, England. I looked on the map and found
all these towns less than 10 miles apart.

In February of 1951 Ann and James were baptized members of the church. By this
time they had had 4 children, but only 2 were living. Two years later they left
England with a group of English and Welsh saints. The ship Jersey went from
Liverpool to New Orleans. They only had one death on the ship. Then they went
by steamer up the Mississippi to Keokuk. At the stops the saints set up guards
on the ship so people would not come off the land and try to steal their
possessions. The robbers would ask to see Robert O'Connor or any other Irish
name because many ships had people from Ireland on them, but this company was
just English and Welsh and so they were not as vulnerable.

At Keokuk they bought wagons, cattle and food for their journey. Some in the
company had come from England in what was called the 10 pound company. They
were trying to make the whole trip on only ten pounds per person. They had ten
people and 3 cows per wagon. This caused the company to be short on food by
time they reached the valley. The leader of their company was a nephew to
Brigham Young, Joseph Watson Young. He had married a year earlier and his young
wife was very ill. Brother Young left the company early calling new leaders.
James Cook was called as a captain of 10 wagons. Brother Young only made it to
the crossing of the Green River before his wife died. He took her body on into
Salt Lake City then returned to help his company.

At one time a group of 500 Pawnee Indians stopped the company near their
village and demanded payment before allowing the company to move on. They
threatened the company until each family gave up something such as knives,
kettles, watches, jewelry, etc. Another time the 10 that James was leading was
left behind because they were short on oxen to move their group. But they were
able to catch up.

James and Ann and their two children moved to Manti the spring following their
arrival in the valley. James arrived there with only 10 cents in his pocket,
but he worked hard and was able to build an adobe rock home that still stands
today. He became a successful farmer owning 30 acres of land. He also was a
wagon maker or wheelwright.

In Manti the family continued to grow until Ann had given birth to 9 children.
The first daughter married another of my great-great grandfathers as his 3rd
wide. The 3rd daughter of Ann and James married the son of that great-great
grandfather and they are the ones I descend through.

Like other men of his time James took more than one wife. About the time Ann's
youngest child was born James was sealed to a lady who had come to Utah with
her only two living children. Her husband, a hatter remained behind in England.
James never lived with this wife, Hannah. He just supported her and her
children. But he did marry Hannah's daughter, Maria, a divorc√©e with two
children. He cared for the children from her previous marriage as if they were
his own. In fact after Maria and Ann died the census says that Maria's 14 year
old boy and Ann's 15 year old daughter were still living with him.

In Manti the family struggled to have enough food to eat the first years they
were there because of what was called the grasshopper war. They ate pigweed,
thistles, and sego lily root. They also had problems with Indians and James and
his son-in-law to be my great grandfather Barton fought in the Blackhawk war
for a few months. The family years later received a tombstone for James for his
labors in the war. James outlived all three of his wives dying at 90 years of
age.
