<h3 id='written_by_himself'>Written by Himself</h3>

<p>A sketch of the life of Joel H. Johnson, son of Ezekiel Johnson, who was born at Uxbridge, Massachusetts, January 18, 1776. My mother&#8217;s name was Julia Hills, born at Upton, Massachusetts, on September 26, 1783. They were married at Grafton, Massachusetts on January 12, 1801, and I was born at Grafton, Massachusetts, on March 23, 1802.</p>

<p>When a small child my parents emigrated to the state of Vermont, where they lived about nine years, and in the year of 1813 my parents let me go with my uncle Joel Hills (for whom I was named) to New Port, in the state of Kentucky, on the opposite side of the Ohio river from Cincinnatti(sic), both very small towns then.</p>

<p>In the spring 1815, my father came and took me to Pompret, Chautauqua County, state of New York, where I lived with him, until I was twenty-one years of age,-March 23, 1823. Had little or no opportunity for education but was very religious from a small child, not daring to transgress the will of my parents or to do the least thing I thought to be wrong and always attended religious meetings and studuied(sic) my books by firelight after I had done work. I bought a sawmill and lot of land and built a house, and my sisters kept house for me until the second day of November, 1826, when I married Miss Anna P. Johnson, daughter of Timothy Johnson, Esq: she was born August 7, 1800. In the year of 1829, I invented and patented the shingle cutter or machine now used for making or cutting shingles throughout U.S. and Canada. The patent dated the 8 of December, 1829 and signed Andrew Jackson, Pres., and Martin Van Buren, vice President of the U. S.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1830 I moved my family to the town of Amherst, Lorain County, State of Ohio. I there first became acquainted with the Book of Mormon and the Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints, and was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ on the first day of June, 1831, and was ordained and(sic) Elder on the 20th of Sept. following and appointed to preside over the Amherst branch of the Church numbering about one hundred members. I attended the first October conference of the Church; it was held in Orange Township, Ohio, 1831, where I first beheld the face of the prophet Joseph and heard the words of life from his mouth which felled(sic) my heart with joy and thanks to God.</p>

<p>In January, 1832, I went on a mission to the state of New York, preaching the gospel and visiting my father&#8217;s family in Pompret. They willingly heard and believed and my mother and some others were baptized. On my return home I baptized many in and about Amherst and ordained several Elders and Priests.</p>

<p>In July, 1833, president Smith counseled me to move to Kirtland and buy out certain obnoxious individuals which I did. I was there when the foundation of the Temple was laid, and built a sawmill for its benefit.</p>

<p>On August 26, 1835, I went on a short mission through the southeast part of Ohio, preached in many cities and towns, baptized several and returned home. I labored preaching in all the towns abut Kirtland, baptized many and ordained several Elders and Priests. Received a blessing under the hands of the First Presidency for my labors in preaching, assisting in building the Lord&#8217;s house. I was present at the calling and ordination of the first twelve apostles, also at the calling and ordination of the different quorums of the Church. I attended the dedication of the Lord&#8217;s house on the 27th of March, 1836, and all the meetings and councils that followed, saw and heard the power of God manifested as mentioned in the life of Joseph Smith, and was chosen a member of the quorum of seventies, went on several missions, etc.</p>

<p>I helped to organize the Kirtland camp in 1838 and traveled with it as far as Springfield, ILlinois; was called by council to stop there and take care of the sick. I commenced preaching and soon gathered a branch of the Church of forty members over which I presided until January 8, 1839, when the Lord showed me by revelation that I must immediately go to Carthage in Hancock county. I packed up, went with my family and commenced preaching in Carthage and vicinity, and baptized many and organized a branch of the Church of about fifty members called the Crooked Creek branch. About that time Sidney Rigdon, Bishop Partridge and others called on me while on their way to old Commerce to seek a location for the saints who were being driven from Missouri. The location was made and called Nauvoo. In February, 1840, I purchased a sawmill and a piece of land on Crooked Creek on which I moved my family. In July we as a branch of the Church were organized into a stake of Zion with all of its officers and quorums.</p>
