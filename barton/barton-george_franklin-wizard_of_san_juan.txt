# The Wizard of San Juan

By Joel W Norton

He came to San Juan County  
To help reclaim the land.  
Sage brush fields would disappear  
As if by waving his hand.

'Twas hard work without a doubt  
To make from desert a rose.  
It just looks by all he touched  
Remarkable wizardry shows.

He did carry his water  
In little kegs made of wood.  
Drink from a bag made of cloth  
It seems by magic he could.

Another amazing sight  
At the forge with clever hands  
Shaping the tools and plow shears  
Whatever his need demands.

So made were these impressions  
On the mind of one small lad.  
Confirmed-and not forgotten  
By one experience had.

Taking a taste from a jar  
The lad thought he was alone.  
No one to see his mistake-  
But the wizard had been shown.

"Don't do like that on a farm  
Poisons and dangers abound.  
This time all that you tasted  
Was old deodorant found."

Now this day the wizard showed  
Strength to safeguard family.  
How did he learn? In a dream?  
Or a vision readily?

Who is this man of magic?  
Who is this wizard of fame?  
From his is our legacy-  
George Franklin Barton's his name!
