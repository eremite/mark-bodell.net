<p>Ruth Williams, my grandmother, was born April 14, 1816 at Breconshire, South Wales. She was the daughter of Daniel and Ruth Jones Williams. Her brothers and sisters were Rodrick, Williams, Reese, Daniel, Mary, John and Samuel. Grandmother was 5&#8217; 3&#8221; tall with brown hair, which she parted in the middle and combed straight down on both sides and pinned in a bob at the nape of her neck. She was heavy set. She was very patient and had a kind and loving disposition.</p>

<p>She married John Evan Price in May 1841. They started life together at Aberygyr where they lived until 1845. They then moved to Llanelly Mertyban Parish where Isaac was born on May 7, 1845 and died in 1846. Another son, David, was born to them on March 4, 1847. He died the same year. A daughter, Ruth, was born on April 16, 1848. On May 1, 1850, another daughter, Mary, was born. Grandmother was alone at the time. The only food they had was dry bread and barely enough water for her and her two small girls. A few days later she did her washing and caught cold. She was confined to bed for many months.</p>

<p>They were the only Latter-day Saints in that community and none of the people would go near them. The persecution was very bitter. My grandfather cared for her and took care of the baby. She was a firm believer in prayer. She and her husband prayed continually for her recovery and acknowledged the hand of the Lord in her life being spared. Another instance when her prayers were answered was when she had no food in the house and prayed for help. She had a prompting to go into the street. She laid her baby down and walked out into the street, not knowing what to expect. She saw nothing and was turning to go back into the house when a small whirl wind rose a few feet in front of her and when it ceased, it had uncovered a pound sovereign. She was filled with joy and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Grandmother was blessed with the gift of tongues, both in speech and song. She always wore the traditional Welsh hood and clothing. She did not believe in having pictures taken. She likened them to the worship of idols and wanted no pictures of people. One day while standing on a chair or stool to wind her clock, she fell and broke several bones in her foot. Not having proper medical care, she was left with a crippled foot and leg the remainder of her life.</p>

<p>Three other children blessed their home; Daniel Evan, who was born November 17, 1852; John Evan, on January 18, 1855 and Ann Maria, who was born June 14, 1859. Grandmother was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was baptized 17 October 1847 by John Griffith. She had a desire to come to this country and raise her children in a land where there was freedom of worship.</p>

<p>They left Liverpool, England May 1865 on the ship Bridge Water. They were five weeks and two days sailing from Liverpool to New York. From New York they went to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to join the Welsh immigrants. They stayed in Pittsburgh months and went from there to Detroit to join the Mormon pioneers and migrate west. They left Wyoming, Nebraska on July 18, 1866, and made the long trek westward by ox team in Captain Holiday&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>On September 25, 1866, they arrived in Salt Lake City and were treated very kindly by the Saints. President Brigham Young shook hands and welcomed them all. They stayed in Salt Lake City three days and started on their journey to Malad to join their daughter, Ruth, who had married Fredrick Thomas. On the way they were stricken with mountain fever and grandmother was confined to bed for two months.</p>

<p>They came to Malad and stayed with Ruth until they were able to build a home of their own. They sold their home for a wagon and a team of oxen and grandmother moved to what is now known as Samaria, Idaho, where grandfather had taken 160 acres of land. Her first home was a dugout near a spring of water. She was the only white woman there. In two months other pioneers went there to make their homes and were truly welcomed by grandmother and her family. She was a very hard worker. Although she was on crutches and had poor health, she carded wool, spun yarn and knit clothing for her family. Through all the hardships she suffered, and her poor health, she always maintained her patience, a jovial disposition and outstanding courage.</p>

<p>She passed away September 20, 1873, and was buried the next day at Samaria, Idaho. She contributed much to the valley in the posterity she left behind through the following daughters and sons: Mrs. David (Esther) Edwards, Mrs. John (Mary) Jones, Mrs. Fredrick (Ruth) Thomas, Mrs. William (Ann Maria) Rodrick, Daniel E. and John E. Price.</p>
