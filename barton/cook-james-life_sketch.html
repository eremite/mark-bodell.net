<p>Read Trail Excerpt:</p>

<p>Following is a detailed account of Capt. Joseph W. Young&#8217;s company crossing the plains from Keokuk, Iowa, to Salt Lake City {in 1853} written by Elder Henry Pugh, the clerk of the company. The ship &#8220;Elvira Owen&#8221; sailed from Liverpool, England, Feb. 15, 1853, and after a successful voyage landed at New Orleans {March 31, 1853} with a company of about 350 {L.D.S.} emigrants in charge of Elder Joseph W. Young. From New Orleans the journey was continued up the Mississippi River by river steamer to Keokuk, Iowa, where they arrived April 13th. Keokuk had been selected this year as the outfitting place for the Saints who crossed the plains to Salt Lake City. Here in the vicinity, the emigrants {in charge of Capt. Joseph W. Young}, remained upwards of a month, making the necessary arrangements and purchases of animals, wagons, tents, etc., for the journey across the plains. On May 20th the company, consisting of 56 wagons, 224 oxen and 420 souls were organized at Keokuk and at once proceeded on the march out upon the prairie and camped at New Boston, Lee Co., Iowa, where the emigrants remained several days waiting for the delivery of cows, for the &#8220;Ten Pound&#8221; company and otherwise preparing for the long overland journey. New Boston was a village situated about ten miles north of Keokuk in Lee County, Iowa.</p>

<p>Friday, May 27. A meeting was held at the corral at New Boston of the first organized company of the &#8220;Ten Pound&#8221; emigrating Saints, at which Joseph W. Young was sustained as president of the company; Bro. Parry as captain of the 1st fifty (with the privilege of selecting his captains of tens) and Elder Rostrum as captain of the 2nd fifty with a like privilege. Elder Henry Pugh was chosen as clerk of the company. At this meeting is was also decided that each captain should appoint a clerk for each of the fifties and that these {clerks} furnish the president {or captain} as early as convenient with the names and ages of each person in their respective fifties and also the number of wagons, oxen, cows, dogs and all other living creatures whatsoever. It was also decided that each wagon should be numbered according to its respective fifty and ten in plain painted characters on the off side and also the number of each wagon from 1 upwards in each fifty; that on the march the teams should move in order according to their number, and in no case deviate there from, or pass each other on the roads, unless otherwise directed by the president or captain of fifties, who may receive their instructions from the president {or captain of the whole company}. After a few words of counsel, encouraging the Saints to be faithful diligent and ready to assist each other, keeping always in view the unity of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Saturday, May 28. Sister Christiana Reeves, aged 35 years died at the camping grounds at New Boston, after about four months sickness, but had only been confined to her bed about eight days. She had lost her infant son John at the camp at Keokuk, aged 16 months, on the 19th inst.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 29. The Saints are all well and comfortable in camp this morning. Capt. Joseph W. Young left the camp for Keokuk to attend a meeting there called by Elder Isaac C. Haight. A storm of thunder, hail and rain occurred in the afternoon. Captain Young returned to camp in the evening. Wednesday, June 1. {Part of the} company left New Boston for Sugar Creek , being short of grass and water for the cattle. The line of march was attended with order and precision. At five o&#8217;clock p.m., when within three miles of Sugar Creek, rain began to fall in torrents and continued until midnight. The roads soon became almost impassable, and it was found necessary to halt until morning.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 2. Captain Joseph W. Young and several of the {brethren and} sisters were very ill during the night with diarrhea. The roads were very muddy and we had to double teams as we proceeded on our journey. We arrived at Sugar Creek after considerable difficulty at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m.</p>

<p>Friday, June 3. The weather was fair and warm. Capt. Young left the camp for Keokuk and found that the cows had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>Saturday, June 4. A dreadful thunder storm, which continued all day, prevailed at the camp on Sugar Creek. Capt. Young returned {to New Boston} in the evening.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 5. Fair weather this morning, but windy; the roads were in a very muddy state.</p>

<p>Monday, June 6. The weather was fair in the morning. Several other wagons belonging to the company left New Boston for Sugar Creek. Sister Roberts of the first fifty was dismissed from the camp for bad conduct.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 7. Preparations were made to take the final departure from the camping ground at New Boston with the remainder of the company, but Sister Young was found too ill to be moved, so she was left there with her father {(Henry Pugh)}. A meeting was called at which instructions were given to the Saints and Bro. Rostrom was chosen as chaplain of the company, his place thereby becoming vacant, Bro. Winder was appointed to be captain of the 2nd fifty, and Bro. Ellis to succeed him as captain of the fifth ten. Sister Young was reported to be much worse.</p>

<p>Wed. June 8. Sister Young was moved to the camp on Sugar Creek, after which the company left Sugar Creek and traveled six miles out upon the prairie. In the evening a thunder storm came up.</p>

<p>Thurs. June 9. Continuing the journey the company crossed the Madison Road and encamped in a wood about 7 miles from the last camping place, still waiting for the arrival of the cows. A meeting was called by the sound of the trumpet at 6:30 p.m., at which Bro. Rostron [Rostrom], Henry Pugh and John R. Winder spoke.</p>

<p>Friday, June 10 The company traveled about 4 miles and encamped on the Winchester Road. The cows arrived at 3 o&#8217;clock p.m. consisting of a herd of 74 cows and one bull. The cows were disposed of in the following manner, the remainder being dry.</p>

<p>1st Fifty, Capt. Parry; 1st Ten, 3 cows, 2nd Ten, 3 cows; 3rd Ten, 3 cows; 4th Ten, 3 cows; 5th Ten, 3 cows; 6th Ten, 3 cows</p>

<p>2nd Fifty, Capt. John R. Winder: 1st Ten, 3 cows; 2nd Ten, 3 cows; 3rd Ten, 3 cows; 4th Ten, 2 cows</p>

<p>The total number of cows delivered to the companies was 29. The remaining cows were &#8220;Dry and to calf&#8221; - 45 altogether with one bull.</p>

<p>The camping place, where this distribution of cows took place, was 44 miles from Keokuk.</p>

<p>Sat. June 11. The company moved on at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m., passing through Winchester and Birmingham and encamped at 8 o&#8217;clock p.m. about two miles east of Libertyville, where there was plenty of wood {and} feed and water for the cattle.</p>

<p>Sun. June 12. This morning it was found that several of the milch [milk] cows had strayed away. Joseph W. Young and Henry Pugh and several of the brethren returned to a point four miles east of Winchester and brought up 11 of the animals, the camp having, in the mean time, proceeded on the journey and encamped four miles west of Libertyville.</p>

<p>Mon. June 13. The company left the camping ground at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m., passed through Agency City and proceeded to Sugar Creek, where they camped for the night at 8 o&#8217;clock p.m., where there was plenty of wood and water.</p>

<p>Tues, June 14. The trumpet sounded at 3 o&#8217;clock a.m. and the camp was in motion about 4 o&#8217;clock. The company {then} proceeded along the Des Moines River. Passed through Ottumwa and halted for breakfast and feeding the cattle. At 1:30 p.m. the company again moved forward and rested for the night on a good prairie about {four} miles east of Eddyville. The weather was very hot, but the roads were good.</p>

<p>Wed. June 15. The company continued its journey at 7 o&#8217;clock a.m., the first fifty (a Welsh Company) leading, passed through Eddyville and encamped at 1 p.m. four miles west of that city on account of two wagons {belonging} to the Welsh company having broken down and being left behind. The distance of this camp ground from Keokuk was 104 miles.</p>

<p>Friday [Thursday], June 16. In the morning we found that 15 cows were missing and Capt. Young sent Bros. Henry Pugh, Joseph Field and Charles Godfrey to find them At 8 a.m. the camp moved on and halted at 2 p.m., and though much rain had fallen during the past night the roads were in a good condition for traveling. Capt. Joseph W. Young called a meeting in the afternoon and desired that the Ten Pound Company&#8217;s luggage should again be weighed; he gave much counsel for the good of the Saints.</p>

<p>Friday, June 17. The company proceeded on the journey at 7 o&#8217;clock a.m., passed through Oskaloosa, and entered upon the 35 mile prairie for the Dutch town Pella; halted at noon for an hour or two and encamped at 8 o&#8217;clock p.m. having traveled 20 miles without experiencing any accident further than a broken yoke and wagon tongue. Elder John R. Winder being taken sick, the company&#8217;s chaplain, Bro. Rostron, was appointed to officiate for him as captain of the 1st fifty, pro tem.</p>

<p>Sat. June 18. The company left {the} camp ground at 7:30 a.m., passd through Pella and proceeded across the prairie towards Mitchell, where they had good traveling and camped for the night about 7 p.m. During the past two days the company had traveled about 20 miles per day. General good health and spirits prevailed among the Saints, and the cattle having abundance of good feed and water were fast improving and working well.</p>

<p>As Henry Pugh, the clerk of the company, was absent from the camp hunting stray cattle, no particulars of the movements of the company were given for five {successive} days and it can only be stated that the company proceeded on its journey without any known accident. Friday, June 24. The company arrived at the Des Moines River and crossed at Young&#8217;s Ferry; all was well.</p>

<p>Sat. June 25. The company proceeded across the prairie and encamped at Winterset. Sister Elizabeth Griffiths from Penbrokeshire (Stepasaid {Wales} Branch) died about 12 miles east of Winter Quarters, aged 64 years. She was buried on the prairie near yesterday&#8217;s camp ground.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 26. The camp was in motion at an early hour. Proceeded on the journey towards Middle River at 7 o&#8217;clock a.m. Days journey, 21 miles.</p>

<p>Monday, June 27. The company crossed Middle River and proceeded on the 35 mile prairie. As the state road was bad in some places, the company had to round the ridge by which means good traveling was obtained. Encampment was made at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m., 14 miles west of Middle River. Day&#8217;s journey, 18 miles.</p>

<p>Tues. June 28. The company moved off at 7:40 a.m. arrived at noon at Middle Nodaway River, where they had to erect a bridge, which caused some delay, but all got safely across and proceeded on the journey; camped at 7 p.m. three miles west of Wood&#8217;s Farm. Distance traveled during the day, 19 miles.</p>

<p>Wed. June 29. The company left the camp ground at 7:30 a.m. and arrived at the crossing of the {western branch of the} Nodaway River at 9 o&#8217;clock a.m. After repairing the bridge, all the wagons passed over in safety. We arrived at Indian Town at 5 o&#8217;clock p.m. crossed the Nishnabothia River, where the banks were high and rather difficult. Distance traveled 18 miles.</p>

Scott, five miles east of the western Nishnabothnia at 530 p.m. Two miles back Sister Lane, contrary to council, stepped from her wagon while the team was proceeding and fell under the wheel by which her leg was broken. We crossed another creek and camped on the Nishnabothnia.</p>

<p>Fri. July 1. We arrived at the last crossing of the Nishnabothnia where we had to ferry all the wagons over. At 10 a.m. we came up with the last wagon of Bro. Wheelock&#8217;s company crossed Prairie Creek and camped at Silver Creek at 7 o&#8217;clock p.m. Torrents of rain fell during the night accompanied by thunder. (Note. The whole of the wagons were passed over Prairie Creek in 35 minutes. The approaches to this creek were very steep.) Distance, 14 miles.</p>

<p>Sat. July 2. Sister Lane from Southampton, aged 61 years, died last evening and was buried this morning. The company proceeded on at 8:30 a.m. and arrived at the camp ground, four miles east of Kanesville at 4 o&#8217;clock p.m. Here we had to fix up for crossing the Missouri and the plains.

Elders Rostron and Parry were the speakers. The latter spoke in the Welsh language. Another meeting was held at 3:30 when Elder Isaac C. Haight addressed the Saints under a powerful influence of the Spirit. The evening meeting was addressed by Capt. Joseph W. Young.</p>

<p>Monday, July 4. While great preparations were being made and canons roared at Kanesville in celebration of American Independence, the company was in motion at an early hour to a place where a better supply of water and feed for the cattle could be obtained and also to be in a better situation for taking in provisions, etc., for crossing the plains. Here, under the bluffs the company remained until arrangements were made for crossing the Missouri River.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 9. We left the camp ground on our way to Clark&#8217;s Ferry traveled about two miles and camped on the bluff for the night.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 10. We resumed the journey at 7 o&#8217;clock a.m. and traveled until 8 o&#8217;clock p.m. when we camped four miles east of the ferry, having had some bad sloughs to cross, which took considerable time. Distance traveled, 14 miles.</p>

<p>Monday, July 11. We moved the company at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m. and at 10 o&#8217;clock camped at Mesquite Creek, preparatory to crossing the Missouri River.</p>

<p>Friday, July 15. We finished crossing the wagons, cattle, etc. across the Missouri River at Traders&#8217; Point and arrived on the prairie west of the Missouri River about three miles distant at sunset, where we camped.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 16. As several wagon wheels required repairs, the company could not move until 6 o&#8217;clock p.m. We then proceeded about 3 miles and found six cows belonging to some of the other companies, four of which were yoked. Distance traveled, about three miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 17. We proceeded on our journey, traveled 10 miles, and camped at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m.</p>

<p>Monday, July 18. We resumed the journey at 7 o&#8217;clock a.m., traveled 17 miles and arrived at the Elkhorn at 6 p.m. Here two brethren, in pursuit of the six cows taken up the 16th inst., came up with the camp and claimed the same; the {cows} had strayed from Capt. Gate&#8217;s company, while crossing the Missouri River.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 19. We ferried our wagons across the Elkhorn, and swam the cattle. About 10 o&#8217;clock a.m. rain began to fall heavily, which made the approaches to the river difficult. We camped for the night on the west bank, finding it impossible to proceed on account of the rain.</p>

<p>Wednesday, July 20. The roads were heavy and difficult to pass over. We traveled, this day, 10 miles, and camped near the Elkhorn at 3 p.m., the cattle being very tired.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 21. We moved off at 7 a.m., traveled about 20 miles and camped without wood or water at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m. We left the camp ground of last night at 5 o&#8217;clock a.m. Distance traveled 20 miles.</p>

<p>Friday, July 22. We left the camp ground of last night at 5 o&#8217;clock a.m. and arrived at Shell Creek at 10 o&#8217;clock. Here we rested and refreshed the cattle until 2:30 p.m., when we proceeded and camped where there was water, but no wood, at 8 o&#8217;clock. Distance traveled, 20 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 23. We proceeded on our journey at 7:45 a.m. and arrived at the Loupe Fork Ferry at 2 o&#8217;clock p.m. The weather was hot and sultry. As we found the river too high to cross, we had to camp on the eastern bank, after traveling during the day 12 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 24. We rested this day. Meeting was held at 10:30 a.m. when the Saints were addressed by Capt. Joseph W. Young. Bro. John Spriggs and Mary Ann Elizabeth Wood were married by Joseph W. Young.</p>

<p>Monday, July 25. We crossed all the wagons by ferry {across Loupe Fork} and swam the cattle across Loupe Fork. We camped at sunset on the west bank of the river.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 26. We continued the journey at 9 o&#8217;clock a.m. over good roads and camped at 3:30 p.m. about half a mile southwest of the Loupe Fork, after traveling 14 miles.</p>

<p>Wed. July 27. We moved off at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m. and found good roads until we came to the sand hills; then it became heavy work for the teams, but after pounding the same roads again, became good and ran parallel with Loupe Fork. We camped within watering distance from the river, where there was plenty of wood within half a mile. Day&#8217;s journey, 16 miles.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 28. We left the camp ground about 7:30 a.m. {and} saw several stray oxen on the opposite bank of Loupe Fork; we dispatched some of the brethren in search of them, but they failed to capture any. After traveling 15 miles, we camped at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>Friday, July 29. Twenty­four volunteers left the camp at 2 o&#8217;clock a.m. to endeavor to find and capture the oxen seen yesterday. They returned during the day without being able to find the oxen, or even their tracks. The company moved off about 9:45 a.m. and proceeded over the sandy hills where the roads were rather difficult, but there was plenty of water. After traveling 10 miles, we camped at 6 p.m. where there was no wood. Here we used buffalo chips to make fires for the first time.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 30. We moved off at 7 o&#8217;clock a.m., the roads being sandy for about six miles. Then we took the old road for Prairie Creek, where we met 27 Elders on their way to fill missions in Great Britain and other places. We crossed Prairie Creek in safety. One wagon was upset, but no serious injury sustained. We crossed the creek, which in Clayton&#8217;s guide is referred to as being dry, but we found at least two feet of water in it and a good sandy bottom. We were delayed somewhat here with a few of the Welsh Company&#8217;s teams, which made it rather late before all the teams got across. The company proceeded at good speed, although several sloughs had to be crossed, intending to make Wood River. We traveled until 9 o&#8217;clock, when, finding a deep, wet slough about two miles east of Wood River, we were obliged to camp for the night, after traveling about 14 miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 31. The camp was aroused at 5 o&#8217;clock a.m. and the teams made ready as quickly as possible. We crossed a bad slough, and forded Wood River, which was 2 1/2 feet deep and encamped at 9 a.m. near the Platte River, where we had plenty of wood, water and grass and where we remained for the rest of the day after traveling only three miles. A meeting was held at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m. at {which} the Saints were addressed by Joseph W. Young, Isaac C. Haight and Levi Stewart. The last two named brethren have traveled with us the past three days, and they gave good counsel to the Saints. Elder Isaac C. Haight had found that the care of the whole company, together with that of a sick wife, was too much of a burden for Joseph W. Young to bear so he proposed that an {assistant} captain of the company be nominated to act under Joseph W. Young&#8217;s direction. Agreeable to this advice Elder William Parry was unanimously elected to this office. Bro. Hakin {Wm. Hockin} was also appointed captain of the first fifty instead of Wm. Parry and Bro. Cook, captain of the 3rd Ten, succeeding Bro. Hockin. After the meeting, the Saints retired to their tents rejoicing in the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Monday, August 1. We moved off at 7:30 a.m. {and} halted after traveling 12 miles at 1 o&#8217;clock p.m. When the camp was again in motion, a severe thunder storm came on, {this} together with some wretched sloughs to cross, and bad roads, caused us {to make} only 8 miles, when we camped at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m. all drenched to the skin. Day&#8217;s journey, 20 miles.</p>

<p>Tues. Aug. 2. We moved off at 7:10 a.m. and found the roads very bad, it ran parallel with Grand Island. After halting at noon for an hour, and continuing our journey, we came up with a large tribe of Pawnee Indians whose begging was incessant until after sunset, when, after some difficulty, we got rid of them. One of the braves and five Indians remained in camp, for whom we fixed a tent, and made them comfortable. Extra guards were set and each man {was} required to watch his wagon. Day&#8217;s journey, 15 miles.</p>

<p>Wed. Aug. 3. The Camp was aroused at 4 o&#8217;clock a.m. The Indians we had entertained left soon afterwards, but several others were on the ground before daylight and followed the train for some distance. We were on the march before five o&#8217;clock a.m., and after proceeding about five miles, we halted for breakfast until 9 o&#8217;clock. We had several bad sloughs and creeks to cross. The roads were bad {and} in places completely inundated. We halted for the night about 7 p.m. after a very tiresome drive of 17 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Thurs. Aug. 4. The trumpet sounded at 4 o&#8217;clock a.m. but we did not move until 8 o&#8217;clock as many of the sisters had to prepare bread, etc. for the day. We built a new bridge and crossed Elm Creek in safety. At 10 o&#8217;clock a.m. we arrived at the next creek which we crossed with some delay. By 11:45 o&#8217;clock we continued our way over bad roads and had to cross several deep ravines. After traveling during the day 13 miles, we camped at 4 o&#8217;clock p.m. on Buffalo Creek. During the evening, Sister Blackwell, who had been sick for two weeks became worse and died at 10 p.m. She was from St. Clair&#8217;s Branch, Caermarthenshire Conference, Wales. Her former name was Bridget Davis. She was married on board the ship &#8220;Jersey&#8221; by Elder William Parry to Benjamin Blackwell. Her age was 45 years and she was buried near Buffalo Creek.</p>

<p>Friday, Aug. 5. The camp was aroused at 4 o&#8217;clock a.m. and sent some men forward about 3 miles to erect a bridge. William Hockin, captain of the first fifty was ordained an Elder by Joseph W. Young. We moved off at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m. and arrived at {the} crossing of Buffalo Creek at 10 o&#8217;clock. We found the approaches to that stream steep, halted for an hour at 1 o&#8217;clock p.m. and camped for the night at 7 o&#8217;clock, about a mile east of the Platte River. Distance 21 miles. Bro. Hockin, mentioned above, was from the Southampton Conference, Eng. He was a married man, 27 years old, without children; he had not previously been ordained to any office in the Priesthood.</p>

<p>Saturday, Aug. 6. We proceeded on our journey at 7:30 a.m., found the roads tedious and the weather hot. We stopped for noon at 2 o&#8217;clock p.m. and camped for the night at 5 p.m. near the Platte River. Soon after sunset a tremendous thunder storm came on and continued with much rain until after midnight. The rain poured into wagons and tents while the wind was blowing a hurricane, overturning many of the tents and leaving the inmates in a deplorable condition. Day&#8217;s journey, 16 miles.</p>

<p>Sunday Aug. 7. We remained in camp until 3 o&#8217;clock p.m. for the purpose of drying bedding, clothing, etc. We then proceeded on our journey, traveled eight miles and camped near the Platte River at 7 o&#8217;clock p.m.</p>

<p>Monday, Aug. 8. We moved off at 8:15 a.m., passed the Sandy Bluffs which we found heavy work for the teams; at 11:45 we arrived at Skunk Creek, where we halted for an hour. On starting again at 1 p.m., a messenger arrived with the information that Capt. Joseph W. Young had killed {a buffalo} and he desired the company to stop until it was brought to camp. This delayed the company until 4:50 p.m. On arriving at the Pawnee Swamp we were again delayed owing to the breaking of an axletree. After traveling during the day 6 miles, we stopped for the night at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>Tues, Aug. 9. The company, excepting the 6th Ten of the 2nd Fifty, moved off for the crossing of Skunk Creek at 8:45 a.m. The above mentioned ten remained with the broken wagon until it was repaired and then followed us at 2:30 p.m. On arriving at the crossing of Skunk Creek, we found that the 1st Ten of the 2nd Fifty had been left there on account of the second wagon having broken an axletree. Also Capt. Parry with the remainder of the company had proceeded towards Carrion Creek. Capt. Joseph W. Young therefore decided to remain on Skunk Creek until a new axletree was fixed. Shortly after our arrival, a buffalo calf, chased by a wolf hanging to her tail came close up to our encampment. Joseph W. Young and others of the brethren gave chase and succeeded in capturing the calf. Day&#8217;s journey about 3 miles.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Aug. 10. The broken wagon having been repaired, we proceeded at 10:30 a.m., halted at Cold Water Springs at 3 p.m. when a severe thunder storm broke loose upon us and continued with torrents of rain until 6:30 p.m. After a second halt, we again proceeded on our journey and caught up with the camp at 8 p.m., after traveling 16 1/4 miles .</p>

<p>Thursday, Aug 11. We proceeded at 9 o&#8217;clock a.m., traveled 6 miles to the place named by Wm. Clayton as &#8220;Last Timber&#8221; but found no timber at all. We halted for an hour and diverted the road in order to avoid a bad slough. We then proceeded to Black Mud Creek. The tongue of one wagon broke. This being repaired, we crossed the creek and encamped at 7 p.m. after traveling during the day 9 1/4 miles.</p>

<p>Friday, Aug. 12. The camp was aroused at 4:30 a.m. and at 7 o&#8217;clock we found a deep slough about 1 1/2 miles ahead and it took us until 10 o&#8217;clock to cross it. We also found the road very soft and bad, yet no accident took place. After halting an hour for noon, we resumed the journey and arrived at the North Bluff at 3 o&#8217;clock p.m. which we forded in safety by doubling teams. Soon we came to the east foot of Sandy Bluff where we found the sand deep and excessively heavy for the cattle. After traveling 15 miles, we stopped at 7 p.m</p>

<p>Sat. Aug. 13. We marched off at 7:55 a.m. along the sandy bluffs. The morning was cool and pleasant, but the traveling very heavy. We halted for noon from 12 to 2:30 p.m. The cattle being refreshed we traveled through the sand pretty well, but quite a number of the oxen have sore necks. After crossing Bluff Creek, we encamped for the night near the west foot of the Sandy bluffs, after traveling through the day 12 miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, Aug. 14. We proceeded on our journey over Sandy Bluffs, Creek, etc. at 7:30 a.m. and encamped off Goose Creek at 2:30 p.m., where the lead cattle of Capt. Joseph W. Young&#8217;s wagon turned suddenly around into the creek, by which the off side fore wheel was broken. Thus ends a week of disasters, as we have had to fix two new axletrees, repair two or three tongues, one wheel and put in new spokes. Day&#8217;s journey, 5 1/2 miles. The total distance traveled during the past week, 67 miles.</p>

<p>Monday, Aug. 15. We moved off at 8:30 a.m. and for two or three miles the roads continued heavy and sandy, but on nearing the river we had good traveling for the cattle. We halted at 1 o&#8217;clock p.m. near Rattlesnake Creek. The cattle being much fatigued, we rested until 5:30 p.m., crossed the creek and halted at 8:15 p.m., after traveling during the day 15 miles.</p>

<p>Tues. Aug 16. We proceeded on our journey at 7:30 a.m. and found the roads still sandy. We halted at Camp Creek at 11:30 a.m. the cattle being fatigued with hard roads and hot weather. We moved on again at 5:30 p.m. and camped on Woolf Creek at 8:20. Day&#8217;s journey, 10 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Aug. 17. The camp was aroused at 4 o&#8217;clock a.m. After doubling our teams, we proceeded across the sandy bluffs. We halted at 1:20 p.m. about three fourths of a mile west of Watch Creek, where we crossed another creek, about two rods wide, not mentioned in the guide. Here we halted until 4:40 p.m. looking out for the &#8220;Lone Tree&#8221;, but as we did not find it we supposed it had been cut down. We arrived at a point opposite Ash Hollow at 7 p.m. where we crossed a slough not mentioned in the &#8220;Guide&#8221;. After crossing Castle Bluff Creek by moonlight, we camped for the night at 8:30, after traveling 14 1/2 miles, according to the guide book; the actual distance was not less than 17 miles.</p>

<p>Thurs. Aug. 18. We moved off at 8:15 a.m. passed Castle Bluff and Sandy creeks and halted an hour for noon. We found the roads pretty good except where they were sandy for about a mile. Continuing the travel at 1:30 p.m. we halted again at 4:15, watered cattle and moved forward once more at 5:55 p.m. After traveling through the day 17 miles, we camped at 7:40 p.m., south of the road near the Platte River.</p>

<p>Friday, Aug. 19. The funeral of Bro. Nalder&#8217;s child (Sarah Elizabeth, aged 7 months, 21 days) took place {this morning;} she died yesterday. We moved on at 8 p.m. and found the road near the bluffs still sandy and heavy, but on leaving these bluffs we had good roads. We halted at 10:30 west of Crab Creek and proceeded again at 3:30 p.m. crossed the Cobblestone Hills during a terrific storm and arrived at the west foot of said hills where we found the road impassable, and it being an hour after sunset, we found it necessary to camp on the roadside. Some of the wagons did not arrive on the camp ground until 11 o&#8217;clock p.m. Distance traveled, 17 miles.</p>

<p>Saturday, Aug. 20. The camp was aroused at 4 o&#8217;clock a.m. the moon then shining brightly. The company was soon in motion and proceeded towards the river where we halted for breakfast and to feed the cattle, near the Ancient Bluff Ruins. After stopping three hours we moved onward at 9:30 p.m. still traveling over heavy roads. After another halt we continued the journey at 3:30 p.m. and camped {a} little east of the Low Sandy Bluffs at 7 p.m. after traveling 15 miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, Aug. 21. We rested this morning and a council of the captains of hundreds, fifties and tens was called at noon, when it was determined that each man belonging to any wagon should on no account leave the same while the train was moving, but be ready to assist the driver on all occasions when required. A meeting for all the Saints was held at 1:15 p.m., at which Pres. Joseph W. Young exhorted the Saints to diligence, constancy in prayer, union, etc. Some discord having existed, he found it necessary to speak plainly to the camp and scolded them somewhat which, however, was done in an amiable spirit. At 4:45 p.m. the company moved on, traveled 5 miles and camped for the night at 7 o&#8217;clock p.m. on the side of the road opposite Court House Rock. Distance traveled during the week, 73 and three fourths miles.</p>

<p>Monday, Aug. 22. We proceeded on our journey at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m. the weather being rather cooler at first, but on nearing the sands it again became hot. After traveling 12 miles, we halted at 1:15 p.m. After traveling during the day 19 miles we camped at 7 o&#8217;clock p.m. about 7 miles west of Chimney Rock.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Aug. 23. We moved off our camp ground at 8:10 a.m., traveling towards Scott&#8217;s Bluffs, the weather being fair and cool in the morning, but very hot towards noon. We saw a train of 13 wagons and some cattle moving east on the other side of the river. After our noon halt we again traveled on and after traveling during the day about 18 miles we camped for the night between Scott&#8217;s Bluffs and Spring Creek at 7 o&#8217;clock p.m. Here we were visited by some Sioux Indians who came over from the south side of the river.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Aug. 24. We proceeded on our journey at 7:45 a.m. After traveling half an hour we came to Spring Creek, where we halted for noon and then moved forward again and traveled until 6:30 p.m., when we encamped for the night at low sandy bluffs. Day&#8217;s journey, 16 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Thursday, Aug. 25. We broke up our camp at 7:45 a.m. and as we traveled on we found the road very sandy and the weather hot and windy. We halted for noon at a place where timber was again found. In the afternoon we traveled on toward Rawhide Creek and camped 2 1/2 miles east of said creek at 7:45, after having traveled during the day 16 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Friday, Aug. 26. As many of our cattle had strayed during the night the company was delayed in it&#8217;s starting until 9 o&#8217;clock a.m. Joseph W. Young also had to go forward to seek feed for the cattle which for the first time since leaving the Missouri River we now find difficult to obtain. We arrived at Rawhide Creek at 10:20 a.m. and halted for noon near the river to water, feed and rest the oxen. Resuming the journey at 2 o&#8217;clock p.m. we traveled over sandy roads which was heavy work for the teams. We arrived at the ford opposite Fort Laramie at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m. All the Saints seemed to rejoice at the sight of a few houses and that we have thus far been so favored on our journey. It was six weeks this day since we left the Missouri River. After feeding and caring for the cattle, the songs of Zion were heard throughout the camp. We were visited by several Indians who behaved themselves courteously and honestly. Day&#8217;s journey, 14 miles.</p>

<p>Saturday, Aug. 27. We commenced crossing the Platte at 8:30 a.m. by doubling teams; the second fifty leading. All got over in safety by 11 a.m. and at noon we were on our way, finding the roads excessively sandy and hard upon the teams. The first wagons halted about 3 p.m. near the river side, we having to erect a forge and do some blacksmithing. Day&#8217;s travel, 6 miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, Aug 28. The company moved off in the afternoon and proceeded towards the hills. We got all the wagons down the rocky descent and camped near the river at 9 o&#8217;clock p.m. We traveled during the day two miles and during the week past 92 miles.</p>

<p>Monday, Aug 29. We resumed our journeyings at 7:30 a.m. the first fifty leading. At this point we left the rock descent 7 1/2 miles west of Fort Laramie and found the roads rocky and troublesome. We took the old pioneer road and presumed that we were the only company that had traveled that road that season. We camped on Bitter Creek at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m. after traveling during the day 17 miles.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Aug. 30. Bro. Eatough of Blackburn Branch, Lancashire, England died this morning at 3 o&#8217;clock aged 43 years. He left a wife and family in easy circumstances in England, he being on his way to Zion intending to prepare a home for his family in the Valley. After burying Bro. Etough at Bitter Creek, and after repairing some wagon wheels, the camp moved off at 10 o&#8217;clock a.m. After a hard day&#8217;s journey over very rough roads, we encamped on Horse Creek at 8 o&#8217;clock p.m., but some of the wagons did not arrive until 9 o&#8217;clock. Bro. Birchell&#8217;s wagon broke down and was left four miles back. Day&#8217;s journey, 18 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Aug. 31. Bro Birchell&#8217;s wagon, for which a wheel was sent at 2 a.m., arrived about 8 o&#8217;clock with several other which had to undergo repairs, therefore we did not move until 3 o&#8217;clock p.m., when we crossed Horse Creek, ascended a rocky bluff and encamped on the third creek, which was dry, and where we had very little feed for the cattle. A terrific storm of lightning and rain came on immediately after the train arrived. The wind blew quite a hurricane throwing over a tent and doing considerable damage. Distance traveled during the day, 6 1/4 miles.</p>

<p>Thursday, Sept. 1. The trumpet sounded at 3 o&#8217;clock a.m., but on account of the darkness of the morning and the boisterous wind we could not move off until 6, when we proceeded on our journey, and arrived at Le Bonte River at 11:45 a.m. Here we had water and feed for the cattle, and remained until 5:30 p.m. when we were again on the march, and encamped about a mile further on. Distance traveled during the day, 12 miles.</p>

<p>Friday, Sept. 2. Breaking up our encampment at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m., we traveled through a hilly country, which was hard on the teams, the oxen suffering much with thirst. We arrived at the LaPrele River, at 7 p.m, with our cattle very much exhausted. About 2 miles back we passed a wagon belonging to Capt. Wheelock&#8217;s company, unable to get along. We endeavored to render assistance, but when within a quarter of a mile within the camp ground the axletree broke, and {we} could not proceed. The brethren with said wagon were without food; their wants were supplied by Pres. Jos. W. Young. Our day&#8217;s journey was 18 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Saturday, Sept. 3. We left the campground at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m., intending to make Deer Creek tonight, but finding the cattle weak, and the roads hard to travel, we halted at 2 p.m., and encamped at Fouche Boise River to recruit, and also to await a few wagons which had been detained by the breaking of a wheel and other causalities. Day&#8217;s journey, 8 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, Sept. 4. We moved forward at 8 a.m., only intending to make Deer Creek, on account of some wagons being left behind, with also the wagon­maker and the blacksmith who had to fix the wagons belonging to Bro. Wheelock&#8217;s company, which, with its party, was disabled. We arrived at Deer Creek at 1:30 p.m., having traveled 9 miles. This day Sister Martha Harris, late of Norris Conference, England, 32 years old, died. She was a single woman. We buried her on the LaPrele River. All the wagons arrived here this evening, together with the one of Capt. Wheelock&#8217;s company. During the past week we had traveled 90 1/4 miles.</p>

<p>Monday, Sept. 5. Finding that more than 20 wheels required setting, and having to search for coal, fix the forge, and commence repairs, we were busily engaged all day, and then could not complete the work. We drove the cattle to pasture, about 2 miles away, where they got pretty good feed.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Sept. 6. We completed repairs, and moved off the camping ground at 2 o&#8217;clock p.m. After traveling 7 1/4 miles, we encamped for the night at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Sept. 7. We proceeded this morning at 8:30 and traveled over pretty bad roads, halted for noon about one hour, and encamped for the night at 7 o&#8217;clock p.m., near the Two Ravines, within 4 1/2 miles of the Upper Platte ferry and ford. Day&#8217;s journey, 17 miles.</p>

<p>Thursday, Sept. 8. We moved off at 7:30 a.m., and arrived at the Ford at 10 o&#8217;clock a.m. Here we crossed the wagons in safety on to the north side of the Platte. At 10:40 a.m., taking the new road along the river, we found it hilly and troublesome, but after leaving the river they became good. After traveling during the day 20 1/2 miles, we camped for the night within 4 miles of the alkali springs and creek at 7 p.m.</p>

<p>Friday, Sept. 9. At 7 o&#8217;clock a.m. we proceeded on our journey, traveling over pretty good roads until we arrived at the rocky avenue, when it became tedious until passing the Alkali Springs. We halted at noon at a stream of clear water. On account of having no water last night and but little feed, we made this forenoon journey 10 miles. After stopping for noon, we moved off again at 2:30 p.m., and after traveling during the day 18 and three­fourths, we camped at the creek three hundred yards south of the road.</p>

<p>Saturday, Sept. 10. Sister Mary Ann Roy, late of Bedfordshire Conference, having departed this life during the past night, we buried her on the prairie near the creek mentioned, at 7 o&#8217;clock a.m. The camp moved on at 7:50 a.m., and soon came in sight of Bro. Kendall&#8217;s company, of Capt. Wheelock&#8217;s train, who were encamped at Greasewood Creek, 4 1/2 miles west. The roads were sandy and heavy. We arrived at Independence Rock at 4 o&#8217;clock p.m. Distance traveled, 14 and three­fourths miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, Sept. 11. We moved forward at 9 o&#8217;clock a.m., and encamped at 1 p.m. on the second creek west of Devil&#8217;s Gate. Day&#8217;s journey 7 miles, and the past weeks&#8217; journey, 85 1/4 miles. We met the mail at 9:15 a.m. near Independence Rock, by which mail we received the &#8220;Deseret News&#8221; extra, containing an account of the Utah Indians incursions on the Salt Lake out­settlers. Gov. Young&#8217;s proclamation, instructions, etc.</p>

<p>Monday, Sept. 12. We proceeded onward at 8:20 a.m., halted for noon at 2 p.m., at a place where the road leaves the river (Sweetwater), making 10 miles. In the afternoon we traveled 5 1/2 miles, taking the river road, and encamped near Sage Creek, at 6 o&#8217;clock p.m. Here Sister Elizabeth Smith, late of Southampton Conference, a single woman, 25 years old, died.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Sept. 13. The weather during the past night was very cold, and plenty of ice was found on the water this morning. The funeral of Sister Smith delayed the camp a little, but the company moved off at 8:40 and arrived at Bitter Cottonwood Creek, at 1 p.m., when we halted for an hour. We crossed the Sweetwater River and encamped between the rocks at 6:30 p.m. Day&#8217;s journey, 13 1/2 miles. One birth took place this morning before leaving the campground, namely, Sarah Elizabeth Morris, of the First Fifty, daughter of Isaac and Elizabeth Morris.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Sept. 14. The weather was fair this morning, and the cattle looked better, having had pretty good feed and plenty of water last night. We proceeded at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m., passed the fifth crossing of Sweetwater at 1 p.m., and halted for noon. In the afternoon we faced a boisterous wind and camped without water at 6 p.m., after traveling during the day 7 miles.</p>

<p>Thursday, Sept. 15. Pres. Jos. W. Young&#8217;s horses and those belonging to Bro. Sutton, strayed away during the night, which caused delay this morning. However, the first Fifty moved off at 7:30. The horses were brought in at 10:20, when the balance of the company proceeded, except the fourth Ten of the second Fifty, which remained behind, awaiting the return of several men, who went in search of the horses. As these men had not returned at noon, the fourth Ten proceeded onward and arrived at the Sweetwater at 2:45 p.m. They crossed the ford and halted again for an hour. Soon after starting again, an ox belonging to Bro. Sutton, died almost suddenly, which caused further delay. Bro. Sutton drove his buggy forward, previous to the expiring of the ox, to bring back Bro. Jos. W. Young to have his advice and assistance on their return to the creek. The axletree broke. The wagons then moved on, leaving Joseph W. Young, Bro. Sutton and part of his family with the buggy. On ascending the 1 1/2 mile bluff, they met Bro. Charles Decker, who had traveled with a company to Devil&#8217;s Gate, and was returning to Salt Lake City with information that the first Fifty and a part of the second Fifty had moved off early this morning, had taken the wrong road, and were about 12 miles ahead of us, among the rocks. He had, however, given Capt. Wm. Parry instructions how to regain the proper road and was now n search of his cousin, Joseph W. Young, whom he soon found, and assisted in repairing the buggy. They crossed the river twice after dark and arrived at Decker&#8217;s camp, about 1 1/2 miles from the last ford at 10 o&#8217;clock p.m. Day&#8217;s journey, 14 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Friday, Sept. 16. We proceeded on our journey at 9 o&#8217;clock a.m., the wind still being boisterous, especially while crossing the Devil&#8217;s Backbone, or rough rocky ridge, which, together with the bad roads, made dangerous traveling. We crossed some creeks and encamped in a grove near Quaking Asp Creek at 7 p.m. Day&#8217;s journey, 14 miles.</p>

<p>Saturday, Sept. 17. During the past night, while camping in this hollow, the wind became somewhat still, but in the morning, a snowstorm came on. This part of the company, namely, the fourth Ten of the second Fifty, with Bro. Charles Decker, moved off at 10:15, having as yet seen nothing of Capt. Parry, and the other part of the company. We traveled until 9 o&#8217;clock p.m., when we overtook them within three quarters of a mile of South Pass. The weather was now very cold. Day&#8217;s journey, 16 and three­ fourths miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, Sept. 18. This was the anniversary day of the nuptials of Joseph W. Young and Mary Anna Pugh, they being married in 1852, at Liverpool, England. She had been sick the whole of the voyage and journey from that place, and though now in the last stage of consumption, bears her affliction with fortitude, courage and resignation. Twelve month&#8217;s ago this day, I, her father, Henry Pugh, gave away my first born. Today we part no more to meet again this side of the vale. Jos. W. Young, at his own request, leaves the company, with the intention of reaching the Valley, in company with Charles Decker and others, previous to the expiring of his beloved wife, and gives the whole charge of the train into the hands of Capt. William Parry. Arrangements being completed all moved off together at 2:15 p.m., after which Joseph W. Young soon left us. We passed the summit pacific Creek and Spring and camped south of the road at 7:30 p.m. having neither feed nor water. Day&#8217;s journey 12 1/2 miles and total distance traveled during the week, 104 miles.</p>

<p>Monday, Sept. 19. The camp was aroused at 4 o&#8217;clock a.m. and we proceeded on toward Little Sandy at 6:50. We halted for an hour near the junction of the California and Oregon road at noon, crossed Little Sandy and camped for the night 2 1/4 miles west of that stream. Day&#8217;s journey, about 20 miles.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Sept. 20. We remained in camp this morning to feed the cattle, having traveled 32 miles without feed or water. We resumed the journey at 3:15 p.m., halted at Big Sandy at 6:20 p.m., when we drove our oxen a mile or two to find feed on the banks of the Little Sandy. Day&#8217;s travel, 6 miles. Previous to leaving last night&#8217;s ground a council was held of which the following are the particulars and details.</p>

<p>A council of the officers and Elders of this camp was held at 1 o&#8217;clock p.m. to take into consideration the conduct of Bro. Bailey and others who in consequence of the bacon not holding out to allow each person ten pounds had been making threats to use powder and ball, and thereby endanger the life of Capt. Wm. Parry. There were present at this council Captains Wm. Parry, John R. Winder and Wm. Hockin [Hockins], Elders Richard Rostron, James Ellis James Cook Wm. Speakman, {David} Morgan Jones, John Morris, Griffeth [Griffith] Thomas, Robert Dye, [William] Eddington, William Thomas and Morris.</p>

<p>The council resolved that as it is found upon minute calculation that the best possible care has been taken of the bacon consigned to the 1st fifty by Capt. Parry and his commissary, Bro. Morris and that 9 1/4 pounds has been delivered to each person, some {portions} to sick oxen {and} Indians, and considerable waste having occurred on account of hot weather, it has held out as well as could be expected, and that Bro. Bailey&#8217;s conduct receives censure of this council and that Bro. [William] Eddington, {Henry} Pugh and [Richard] Rostron wait upon him and endeavor to remove the bad spirit from him, which has existed, and also to effect a reconciliation between the parties. At the suggestion of Henry Pugh it was proposed by Elder John R. Winder and seconded by Elder Rostron that this council supports by all possible means Capt. Wm. Parry as leader of this company during the unavoidable absence of Pres. Joseph W. Young. Carried unanimously.</p>

<p>Several parties having refused to watch, the captain of the guard was required to give the names to the clerk of this company on any subsequent refusal to be exposed in the journal to the authorities.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Sept. 21. We proceeded on our journey at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m. over sandy and heavy roads, halted at 1 p.m. to obtain water about 300 yards from the road. Moved again at 2 o&#8217;clock and encamped for the night on Big Sandy. Day&#8217;s journey, 17 miles. Thursday, Sept. 22. We proceeded toward Green River at 10:30 a.m., where we arrived at 3:30 p.m. and there found Bro. Wheelock&#8217;s company encamped. Day&#8217;s journey, 10 miles. Friday, Sept. 23. We remained in camp until 1 p.m. to rest and feed the cattle. We then crossed Green River and halted for the same purpose intending to make a long drive tomorrow. Saturday, Sept. 24. We moved off our encampment at 8 o&#8217;clock a.m., halted for noon at a place where the road leaves the river. The weather was very hot and the cattle weak. We had some difficulty to get them on; several of them gave out entirely. Some of the wagons arrived at the bank of Black&#8217;s Fork about 8 p.m. Other wagons continued to arrive until 11 o&#8217;clock p.m., but several of the teams were driven in without their wagons. The Ten conducted by Capt. Eddington was unable to reach the camp and remained about 4 miles behind. Distance traveled by the main company, 20 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Sunday, Sept. 25. We proceeded towards Hams Fork at 11 o&#8217;clock a.m., but finding good feed on Black&#8217;s Fork, about 2 miles ahead, we halted at 1:30 p.m. Turnetta Garrett, wife of John Garrett, died at 4 o&#8217;clock a.m. and was buried in the camp ground of last night. She was 30 years old and hailed from the South Conference in England. Day&#8217;s journey, two miles. The past week&#8217;s journey, 75 1/2 miles.</p>

<p>Monday, Sept. 26. We moved off at 9 a.m. after setting some wheel tires and arrived at Hams Fork at 10 o&#8217;clock a.m. After fording that stream, and also fording Black&#8217;s Fork the third time, we halted for an hour at noon and encamped at 6:30 p.m. near Black&#8217;s Fork. A thunder storm came on in the afternoon which delayed the company for a short time, but cooled the earth and made it better for the cattle during the remainder of the day. We found very little feed but good feed might have been obtained at the crossing two miles further. Day&#8217;s journey, 13 miles. The Salt Lake Mail, three days behind time, arrived here about 10 p.m. and camped with us for the night, by which I sent the emigrant list to Pres. Brigham Young and also a note to Pres. Joseph W. Young stating the condition of things in camp.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Sept. 27. We moved forward at 8:30 a.m., crossed Black&#8217;s Fork the fourth time about two miles from last night&#8217;s encampment, traveled on until noon when Bro. Winder and I espied some good feed on the river bank within 150 miles of the road. Finding that Capt. Parry had proceeded with the first fifty and first and second tens of the second fifty and also that the third ten had been left behind on account of the weak state of their cattle and also that the cattle of the 4th and 5th tens were suffering from hunger, Capt. Winder and I concluded to avail ourselves of this favorable opportunity and therefore stopped here and refreshed them. We continued the journey at 2 p.m. and caught up with the remainder of the camp about one and a half miles ahead, where they had stopped for the same purpose, but had to drive their teams some distance over the river to feed. We moved off again at 4 o&#8217;clock p.m. and camped on Black&#8217;s Fork about 9 miles east of Fort Bridger, where we had good feed and water. The distance traveled was about 10 miles.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Sept. 28. The guard being off duty during the past night, or neglectful of his duty, as no man was found at his post at 5 o&#8217;clock a.m., five oxen were found fast in the mire, one being quite dead and another nearly so. Capt. Parry was on the spot as soon after the alarm was given as possible with a staff of men who extracted those animals having life. This caused some delay in starting the train, part of which however, moved off at 8:30 a.m. leaving the fourth ten behind awaiting the result of Bro. Sutton&#8217;s oxen&#8217;s recovery and the finding of two cows belonging to Sister Smith. Finding that there was no chance of the ox recovering he was shot at 9:30 a.m. The cows also being found where Capt. Parry nooned yesterday, this part of the company proceeded at 1:40 p.m. and encamped for the night at Fort Bridger, where the company was addressed by Bro. Cummings, who was here in charge of a company of the Nauvoo Legion to protect the emigration against Indian depredations. Here, Henry Pugh received the melancholy intelligence of the death of his dear daughter, the wife of Pres. Joseph W. Young, who left this company with Bro. Charles Decker the 18th inst. trusting to reach the Valley before she expired, but she breathed her last at or near Green River on Tuesday the 20th inst.</p>

<p>Thursday, Sept. 29. We left Fort Bridger at 9 o&#8217;clock a.m. and encamped at the Muddy Fork at 4:30 p.m. after traveling during the day 13 miles.</p>

<p>Friday, Sept. 30. We left a wagon at the Muddy on account of the team being so much weakened by the loss of cattle. {The} wagon was left unbroken in order that it might be taken to the fort, or brought on, at some future period. This, with the delivery of provisions, delayed the camp this morning, and it did not move off till 11 o&#8217;clock. Immediately afterwards we had to cross Muddy Fork, which caused a further delay of 1 1/4 hours. We ascended the long hill (altitude 7,315 feet) and encamped near the east foot of the dividing ridge. Day&#8217;s journey about 13 and three fourth miles.</p>

<p>Here, to the joy and comfort of the company, Pres. Joseph W. Young returned from the Valley about 8 p.m. to again resume his charge. He was accompanied by his brother William and brother­in­law, Guernsey Brown, as assistants. They were received with gratitude and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 1. We moved off at 8:15 a.m. crossed the Bear River and encamped at the clear spring and creek at 5:45 p.m. after a hard day&#8217;s journey of 14 1/2 miles. It was a hard day&#8217;s journey for the cattle as several steep hills had to be ascended.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 2. We continued our journey at 8:40 a.m., crossed Yellow Creek about noon, the road thus far being very good and the cattle being in better condition than for several day&#8217;s past. We met some wagons with provisions for Harmon and Brown&#8217;s companies and encamped at 3:15 p.m. at Cache Cave at the head of Echo Canyon. Day&#8217;s journey 9 and three fourth miles. Here Pres. Joseph W. young and Bro. Guernsey left our camp for the valley to endeavor to obtain teams to assist our company the remainder of the journey. Bro. Young had on his return found that the company {had} lost so many cattle and the remainder were considerably weakened. He left his brother William with us to whom he committed the charge of the company until his return.</p>

<p>Monday, October 3. We broke up our encampment this morning at 9 o&#8217;clock and were met by Bro. Stoker with flour for those who needed any. We encamped at the deep ravine in Echo Canyon where Deputy­captain Wm.G. Young received 442 pounds of flour for which he gave his note to Bro. Stoker, the note being made payable to Bishop Edward Hunter amounting to $66.30. at the rate of $15 per hundred pounds. Day&#8217;s journey, 6 miles.</p>

<p>A meeting was held this evening when several of the brethren spoke. The company also received good instructions from Bishop Harker from the Valley who had come out to meet his mother­in­law, Sister Smith. At the close of the meeting it was proposed and carried with unanimous voice that this company present a testimonial of their affection and esteem to Pres. Joseph W. Young of his great care and excellent management during this journey, and that Bro. Henry Pugh be appointed to draw up the same to be presented upon our arrival in Salt Lake City previous to the disorganization of the company.</p>

<p>Tuesday, October 4. The company was delayed this morning on account of 59 head of cattle being missing. The day guard of last evening having allowed them to stray into the mountains about three miles from camp. However, all were eventually found and we proceeded at 10:40 a.m. We crossed Echo Creek several times and stopped to repair bridges and build one bridge, and although every possible precaution was taken by Bro. W. G. Young one wagon was upset. Happily no person was hurt and not much damage done. We camped with good feed and water at 5 p.m. Day&#8217;s journey, 8 miles.</p>

<p>Wednesday, October 5. We proceeded on our journey at 9:30 a.m. and found the cattle improved by a few days short journeys and good feed. We had some difficult roads through Echo Canyon, but all passed without accident. We encamped on the Red Fork (Echo Creek) of Weber River at 4:30 p.m. where there was plenty of grass, water and wood. Day&#8217;s journey, 9 1/2 miles .</p>

<p>Thursday, October 6. The cattle being pastured {on} the opposite side of Weber River, there was some difficulty in gathering them together on account of which we did not move off the camping ground until 10:45 a.m. We crossed Weber River at the ford by doubling teams and proceeded through Pratt&#8217;s Pass and encamped on the roadside about 1 1/2 mile east of the summit of Long Hill at 4:30 p.m. Day&#8217;s journey, 7 1/4 miles.</p>

<p>Friday, October 7. Moved off this morning at 8:35 and proceeded toward Canyon Creek, where we arrived and encamped at 4:30 p.m. This morning we were met by Pres. Joseph W. Young in company with Bros. Joseph A. Young, a son of Pres. Brigham Young, and friends. They came to our assistance with 24 and a half yoke of cattle. Distance traveled, 9 miles.</p>

<p>Saturday, October 8. We proceeded at 8:45 a.m., completed the passage through the canyon and commenced ascending the Big Mountain at 1:30 p.m. We repaired much of the road and encamped within a quarter of a mile of the summit at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 9. We left the camp ground this morning at 6:30, repaired the road and proceeded down the Big Mountain; arrived at the foot of the last hill at 1 p.m., where we halted to feed the oxen and deliver out flour sent to our aid by Pres. Brigham Young for those who needed it. We ascended and descended Little Mountain and at 6:30 encamped in Emigration {Canyon} within ten miles of the city.</p>

<p>Monday, October 10. We proceeded on our journey this morning at 9 o&#8217;clock. When we arrived at the 7th and 8th crossing of Emigration Creek, we came up with Livingston and Kinkead and Barney&#8217;s goods train and found if we moved further we should get mixed up with them. Therefore, as these crossings were very bad, we set about making a new road under the hill by which both crossings were obviated. We proceeded again at 10 o&#8217;clock noon. We halted several times afterwards to repair the roads where it seemed dangerous, and arrived at the mouth of the canyon about 3 o&#8217;clock p.m. Here we were met by Elders Isaac C. and Hector C. Haight. We ascended the hill on our right and to the joy of all we came insight of the city where we arrived at 5 o&#8217;clock p.m. and encamped on Union Square in peace and security.</p>

<p>Tuesday, October 11. This morning the company was aroused by trumpet sound at 6 o&#8217;clock to prepare for dismissing. At 9 o&#8217;clock a.m. a meeting was called when Pres. Joseph W. Young spoke well to the Saints, enjoining upon them faithfulness diligence, etc. The Saints were also addressed by Pres. Brigham Young who spoke with power and a manifestation of the Holy Ghost, teaching the Saints that which was essential to their future destiny, also bidding them welcome to this delightful vale. By request of the companies, Pres. Brigham Young then broke up the organization, blessed the people in the name of the Lord Jesus and retired. Good counsel was then given by Elders Isaac C. Haight, Wallace and Lorenzo D. Young; the latter pronounced the final benediction and the meeting broke up about 11 o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>The testimonial resolved upon on the 3rd inst. was here presented to our beloved president Joseph W. Young, who acknowledged it in a brief but powerful speech. Thus ends the journal of this company&#8217;s journey to Zion and unto God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost we ascribe, as is justly due, our thanks for the mercies vouchsafed to us, {and} all honor, power and glory, Amen.</p>

<p>At Montrose they met for the first time their future Captain, Joseph W. Young. Before starting out he gave this advice, &#8220;Contend with no one—pray for those who are set over you and they will prove to be a blessing unto you.</p>

<p>In speaking of the organization of the companies she says – &#8220;We had one wagon and one tent to each ten persons. Our rations was one pound of flour and a portion of bacon each day, but we were at liberty to provide extra if we could afford it. There was a commissary to every ten persons, and a captain to every ten, also captains of fifties who assisted Captain Young. The late resident John R. Winder was captain of our fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great deal of patience was required by both captains and people during this trying journey. We had four oxen and two cows to each ten. The wagons were used for our baggage and we walked along the side or ahead of the team, running perhaps once or twice a day for half hour or so. One day I walked twenty miles, the whole day&#8217;s journey. This was the distance we were supposed to cover each day. Sometimes we would have to make camp where there was neither wood nor water nor food for the cattle. In this case we would have to gather buffalo chips with which to make a fire to cook our supper, then rise early the next morning and travel on until we reached a place where the cattle could feed while we cooked and ate our breakfast. We mixed our bread with a piece of light dough or leaven, but often by the time we reached the camp ground, especially in warm weather, our bread would be sour, or if the weather was cold it would not be sufficiently raised, and then we would have to eat heavy bread. After their own supply of food was exhausted, the rations were not sufficient Father [John] Morris would not only walk all the way but carried a shot­gun with which he often shot a rabbit or prarie chicken. One evening when our food was scanty, I asked Grandmother Morris where she got the pepper to put in our rabbit soup. She said there was none and I doubt if anyone in the camp had pepper, yet it certainly seemed to me that I could taste it. One day when it was still colder and our provisions less than ever, our commissary, Brother William Parry, gave us some bread which certainly seemed to have sugar in it, when perhaps there was none in the camp.</p>

<p>One afternoon when we were traveling in the vicinity of the Platte River, we saw at a distance, two objects coming toward us. As they approached, we saw they were Indians, Pawnees, a very savage tribe who were at war at that time with the Souix [Sioux], another savage tribe. At sight of these Indians, the teamsters stopped their wagons and reached for their guns, while the women came to the wagons for protection. As the Indians came to a standstill they said &#8220;Pawnees shoot, Pawnees shoot&#8221;. Then more Indians came dressed in their trappings and war­paint, their numbers increasing every moment. I was not afraid, for something seemed to bear witness to me that they would not hurt us. One of them came and talked to me and wanted the little blue­jacket I was wearing. There was no more traveling that night. After the fires had been lighted the Pawnee Chief came and patrolled our camp all night to protect us from his own band. I sat and looked at him with pride and pleasure, he seemed so noble and grand. I could feel a protecting power over us. It seems to me I can never forget the spirit of calm and serenity that surrounded us as I sat on the ox yoke alone, near the dying embers of our camp fire. And so the night passed and the morning dawned, and we were permitted to continue our journey unmolested and unharmed and filled with gratitude to our Heavenly Father for his merciful protection. When the rivers were too deep for us to cross, the young men would carry us over. I crossed the Wood River on horse­back behind Dr. Dunyon. The night we came on the banks of this river the watchman, in telling the hour, would add—“Mosquitoes tiresome”, but they were more than tiresome—it seemed to me they would devour us.</p>

<p>We crossed the Platte River at intervals during five hundred miles of our journey, and walked much on its sandy banks; in fact, the whole regions of this river seemed sandy. I remember in walking I was so anxious to save the soles of my shoes that I walked in the grass wherever possible, so the uppers wore out first. We found it very trying when the wind was high, especially when it was raining; we would try to put up our tent in order to protect ourselves from the tempest. It often seemed to me that it would lift our canvas home from its foundation after we had succeeded in erecting it, which was a long and tedious process. First hooks, shaped like crochet hooks, were driven into the ground. When a high wind was blowing the tent would be lifted from its holdings as fast as the men tried to fasten the ropes to the pegs. When we came late into camp, tired and hungry, we would have to hunt buffalo chips in the dark and could not get a mouthful to eat until our bread had been baked by this slow process. When the evening&#8217;s work was done, the bugle sounded and we assembled for prayers. In the early part of our journey when the days were long, we would sit on the yokes of the oxen and sing hymns. But as the days grew shorter and the nights grew colder, we often heard the wolves howling not far from our camp. We often passed a post­office which was the skull of an ox or a buffalo bleached white by exposure, upon which was written, probably, as follows; “July 15, 1853, the company of Jacob Gates passed to­ day,—all well.” &#8220;August 15, 1853, the company of Silas Wheelock passed to­day,—all well.&#8221; This news cheered us and we were glad to know that our friends were well and progressing on their journey. A similar message, of course, was added by our Captain.</p>

<p>I must not forget to speak of our little milch cows. These faithful creatures giving milk to supply our journey, were yoked to the wagon between the lead and tongue cattle. They looked very small indeed. Unfortunately our cows became dry, or so nearly dry they gave but a tea­cup full of milk a day. The consequence was that our camp kettle that had been full of good milk gruel for our breakfast became gradually a kettle full of flour starch with only a cup full of milk added. A few days before we reached our journey&#8217;s end teams and provisions were sent out to our aid. I was invited with others to ride. I was so overcome with fatigue and also, perhaps, the reaction at feeling that our tedious journey was so nearly at an end, that I fainted while riding in the wagon. Regaining consciousness I found myself sitting on the ground, my dear mother­in­law in front of me and my husband supporting my back. He was trembling the while and I heard his mother say to him in the Welsh language &#8220;It is the want of food that ails her”.</p>

<p>Before reaching the great Salt Lake Valley we had another high mountain to cross called Big Mountain. We were anxious to get to it but dreaded the ascent. It was a fine day, October 10th, when we reached it. We have previously arranged our attire as best we could after so long a journey in expectation of meeting our friends, as many of the Saints came to greet the companies as they arrived.</p>

<p>There was a great variety of trees growing on the sides of the mountains[.] the roads were hard, level and well trodden. As we descended into the can[y]on below the seenary [scenery] was grand indeed. I remember while ascending the mountain stopping to take breath, I looked around, above and below, and came to the conclusion that never again, in this life, did I want to cross that mountain. I ate some wild berries that I saw on a bush to satisfy my hunger, but they affected me like poison. We had still one more mountain to cross called Little Mountain. Upon descending we began to feel more cheerful, upon meeting persons who had come out to meet their friends or relatives. The first person with whom we were acquainted was Brother Caleb Parry, brother of WM. Parry, our commissary. I was most forcibly struck with the neat, clean and fair appearance of the people as they came up to us. We did not realize that as they looked fair and clean to us we looked correspondingly brown and grim to them. I thought I looked pretty well, for I have taken a good wash every morning before starting our days walk, taking care to shade my face.</p>

<p>On the first day of June, we started our travel to Kanesville. We traveled over three weeks through plenty of mud holes. It was quite a task with unbroken cattle and green teamsters, twelve persons to a wagon and tent. Cyrus H. Wheelock was the Captain of the Company. The Indians were very hostile that summer, but we did not have any serious trouble with them. Long before we reached our journey&#8217;s end, our cattle commenced to die and we had to leave our precious belongings to lighten our load. Before we reached our destination, our provisions gave out and we suffered with hunger. The health of the people was generally good. We arrived in Salt Lake City, October 11, 1853.</p>

<p>Source of Trail Excerpt:<br />Wilkey, Ann Gregory to Dear Children, n.d.</p>

<p>Read Trail Excerpt:</p>

<p>When we began to make preparations to cross the plains, it was April. While waiting for the company to get ready, Sister Alice Ellison gave birth to a daughter the 3rd of May 1853. She named her Alice. We stayed at Keokuk for 6 weeks, then word was given for us to be ready to start on our journey. Then we started on our long and tedious journey across the plains.</p>

<p>Brother Joseph Young was our captain, the company was called the &#8220;ten pound company&#8221;. Our company numbered 53 persons, Bro.[John] and Sis. [Ann Gregory] Wilkey, Bro.[Samuel] and Sis. [Charlotte] Claridge and two children [Elizabeth and Samuel], Bro. [Henry Golding] and Sis. [Elizabeth] Golden, Charles and Elizabeth Wilkey Kemmish and family, Thomas Carter, wife [Mary Ann Goble] and son Hesikiah, Ambrose Hunt and wife [Sophia], Winerd Whitley and wife, Francis [Frederick] Pay and wife [Elizabeth], Bro. [John] Sutton, wife [Mary] and family, Charles Longstone [Longson] and wife, Bro. [John] and Sis. [Susannah] Claxton and daughter [Susannah], Thomas Lane and mother [Mary Lane], Bro. William Eddington and wife [Mary Jane Hales], Bro. [George] Birchell and wife [Sarah], Bro. Ellison, wife and family and a young lady, Bro. Bessent [Isaac Bessant], wife and family, Bro. wife and family and a young lady, Bro. [Benjamin] Ribbick, wife [Mary Ann] and family, Bro. Singleton, wife and family and Sister Lane, an old lady who while trying to get out of the wagon while it was going, fell, the wheel passed over her body. She died the following day. There was also a young woman died of consumption while crossing the plains. When we started we did not realize what our trip would be or did we think of what we would have to pass through before we reached our valley home.</p>

<p>We passed through a place called Laramy [Laramie] at night; when we camped, your father [Charles] and Uncle Charlie Kemmish went back to Laramy for a few provisions, thinking to get there quicker they crossed the mountains and got lost. They traveled on and on and got into a cactus bed. As it was night they could not see. After a while they came to an Indian camp, the Indians were friendly to them. They got through safely but were foot sore and tired. I shall never forget that night, we occupied the same tent as Bro. Francis Pay and wife. He asked Aunt Elizabeth and I if the men had returned, we answered, &#8220;No.&#8221; He consoled us by saying, &#8220;Oh, they are devoured by the wolves or killed with the Indians.&#8221; That was a night of terror and anxiety for us. I would place my ear to the ground, thinking perhaps that I might hear them or their footsteps, but no footsteps or sounds could I hear. Morning came and they did not come. The captain gave orders to start traveling and so we had to go along leaving our husbands behind. The company traveled on until noon and then stopped for dinner and to rest the teams for a little while.</p>

<p>Then they started to travel again, Aunt Elizabeth kept looking back finally we saw two persons coming a great distance behind us which proved to be our husbands. Oh, how thankful we were to see them coming, then we started on our journey again, we traveled until night then we halted to prepare supper. We had to gather buffalo chips to cook our supper with. We were very tired after walking all day for we could not ride in the wagons. We were always in terror, never knowing one minute from another that we would be killed or trampled to death by buffaloes. The Indians would ride up to our wagons in their war paints, great big men. They would frighten us as we did not know what their intentions were. When we saw them coming, the men would gather the wagons as close together as possible, placing the women and children in the wagons and the men would walk each side of the wagons carrying their weapons. Sometimes they were quieted down by giving them a sack of flour. We were once frightened by prarie dogs. Looking ahead we saw what we thought was a large band of Indians. The women and children climbed into the wagons and the men went in head with their weapons. As we came closer to them, they proved to be a band of prarie dogs on a hill sunning themselves. They looked a great deal better to us than if they had been a band of Indians. We traveled along day after day, each day our provisions getting less and the journey very rough. We started out with a pound of flour a day then a half pound, then a quarter of a pound a day then it got to nothing at all.</p>

<p>The night my first child, Annie, was born the first of October 1853, there was not a spoonful of anything in camp. We were then 10 days travel from Salt Lake City. Aunt Elizabeth told me if I had seen the mountains we were going down I would not have stayed in the wagon. It took all the men with ropes tied to the wagons to keep them from tipping. The men had to pull back with all their strength to keep them from turning over. That was hard on the men as well as the horses. The next day after Annie was born teams came from Salt Lake City with provisions and helped us along until we reached our journey end.</p>

<p>We were then placed on the public square in Salt Lake City, with no shelter, but the blue sky above us and the ground beneath no home and nothing to eat and in October. My baby was then ten days old. I was very sick and tired and very weak having had not much food and being sick, but dear friends came. Bro. and Sis. Theabald took us to their home. They had been in Utah two years. We remained with them a few weeks. I had a chance to get rested and regain my strength. It took me a long time to get very strong, I was so run down and half starved.</p>
