<p>by Jean Esplin</p>

<p>Everyone has heard of the Grinch stealing Christmas, but how many people has heard of the year the Japanese stole Christmas?</p>

<p>It was 6PM on December 24, 1944. Vance Esplin was on the USS Eridanus, a merchant marine ship that had been converted into a Navy ship designated AKA 92. Tokyo Rose was singing &#8220;White Christmas&#8221; and the men were feeling homesick. They were carrying jeeps, trucks and other general supplies to Somoa, Espirito Santos and Talagi.</p>

<p>Then the Eridanus crossed the International Date Line and it was then 6PM December 26. Six hours later it was December 26 and Christmas was over. The men hadn&#8217;t gotten any of their Christmas mail except for the Red Cross package containing cigarettes, shaving supplies, candy and mittens. They wouldn&#8217;t get their Christmas mail until May.</p>

<p>Everybody enjoys Christmas and likes their Christmas memories, but Vance Esplin&#8217;s most memorable Christmas was the one of the year it didn&#8217;t come at all.</p>

<p>Vance S Esplin is my father</p>
