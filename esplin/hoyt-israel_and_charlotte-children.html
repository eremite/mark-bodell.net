<h1 id="children_of_israel_and_charlotte_hoyt">Children of Israel and Charlotte Hoyt</h1>

<p>This is just a short sketch of each of our children. How I wish I had a full record of each child. This will just be a small part.</p>
<hr />
<p>ISRAEL VERN HOYT, our first baby was very welcome when he arrived at our home in Orderville, May 28, 1913. He weighed 8 1/2 pounds and had blue eyes and dark brown hair. What a thrill to hold his cuddled in my arms. He was a very sweet baby, and it was a good thing he was so good natured the way we had to learn to care for a baby all of our own.</p>

<p>Vern was blessed June 6, 1913 by Bishop Henry Chamberlain. At the age of eight he was baptized in the reservoir in Alton by Junuis Heaton on June 3, 1921. He was confirmed on the same day by John D. Roundy. He was ordained a deacon on June 7, 1925 by Bishop John B. Heaton. On June 24, 1928, he was ordained a teacher by Israel Heaton. He was ordained a priest on June 1, 19--__, by Heber J. Meeks and later ordained an Elder by Bishop Quimby C. Roundy.</p>

<p>Vern joined the C.C. Camp, February 4, 1934. He had just recovered from the measles and had to work in the river. It was too much for him and he contacted pneumonia and was taken to the Veteran’s Hospital in Salt Lake City. He died there of an embolism</p>

<p>At the time we received word of his sickness, our eleven-month-old baby had measles, and whooping cough, and I was unable to go to him. I went through everything a mother could, but my place had to be with my baby. All I could do was pray and depend on the Lord for comfort.</p>

<p>Vern died on May 16, 1934, and the night he was buried our baby passed away also. I always felt Vern wanted and needed him, so I tried to be brave about it. But, oh, it was hard. Anthony Pendleton of St. George did his endowment work in the temple on June 19, 1935.</p>
<hr />
<p>ORSON CARLOS HOYT Baby Orson was born in Orderville, January 27, 1915. He weighed 10 1/2 pounds. He had dark hair and blue eyes. He was a very pretty baby, but his life lasted only ten days. He was called back home, leaving us heart-broken. Just a little soul budded on earth to blossom in heaven. He was blessed by Bishop Henry Chamberlain in Orderville.</p>
<hr />
<p>LAMOND HOYT Lamond, another baby boy, came to earth just long enough to be blessed and fill our arms for eight hours. Then, he too was called back home. I was so broken up when two babies had been taken I could hardly control myself. Without God’s help I would have been lost, but I found a great comfort in His loving care so I raised my head and understood God knows what is best. Lamond was born in January 2, 1915. He also weighed 10 1/2 pound and had brown hair and blue eyes. He was blessed by Israel H. Esplin.</p>
<hr />
<p>DILWORTH HOYT Dilworth was such a comfort when he arrived on April 19, 1917. We were so frightened for fear something would happen to him, but did enjoy him so much. Aunt Lettie Cox, (the midwife) lived in part of our house and was a great help to us to build our spirits up and assure us all was well with our darling, even if he did cry a lot in the evenings and wanted to walk outdoors. I decided it was because is so, so lonely evenings before he was born.</p>

<p>Dilworth was blessed by Alfred R. Meeks on July 1, 197. He was baptized on May 3, 1924 by Elmer Roundy in the Alton Reservoir and confirmed the same day by Bishop John B. Heaton. On May 5, 1929 he was ordained a deacon by Bishop Quimby Roundy. he was ordained a teacher on August 14, 1032 by Preal George. He was ordained a priest on August 5, 1934 by Bishop Quimby Roundy, and ordained an elder on August 14, 1937 by Myron Elmer Roundy.</p>

<p>He married Edna May Goulding, at Panguitch, Utah, on August 17, 1936. They were both very young, very much in love and happy.</p>

<p>A premature baby girl was born to them on February 19, 1937, but lived just a few hours. They named her Maida. Ardeth, their second daughter was born on May 3,1 938 and Eudell, a sons, was born on October 19, 1939.</p>

<p>When these children were very small May passed away on May 11, 1943. Her mother lived next door and helped Dilworth with the children.</p>

<p>On January 12, 1945, Dilworth joined the Army at Fort Douglas, Utah. He went from there to Fort McArthur in California and from there to the Pacific in japan. The war was over and he was never in action which I was happy about. He was a rifleman, ammunition bearer and military policeman. While he was in Japan he says he and Tom got together, but Rollan had been shipped out. He was released from the military on June 1, 1946 and came back home for a few months.</p>

<p>On November 8, 1946, Dilworth married Elaine Heaton in Alton, Utah. Ardeth and Eudell made a full family.</p>

<p>On September 16, 1948, they were blessed with a little girl they gave the name of LaRue. A son Gerry H. was born on March 5, 1950, and another daughter, Jennie, was born on june 10, 1953.</p>

<hr />
<p>ROLLAN HOYT Rollan, our little curly headed boy, came to join us on April 27, 1919. He was blessed on May 5, 1919 by Fredrick C. Hoyt. He weighed 10 1/2 pounds and had such pretty brown curly hair. We let it grow quite long because it was so pretty and when his father cut it short I felt terrible. Everyone noticed his hair and it made him very self conscious. He was try to plaster it down tight, until be began to notice the girls and they liked it. He was very handsome.</p>

<p>Rollan was baptized by his father, Israel Hoyt, on June 5, 1927, in the Alton Reservoir. He was ordained a deacon on April 26, 1931, by Bishop Quimby Roundy and ordained a teacher on July 8, 1934 by Bishop Quimby Roundy and ordained an elder on july 8, 1940 by Charles C. Heaton.</p>

Then to the Philippines and Japan. he was injured in Germany and has never been in really good health since. He was discharged on December 19, 1945.</p>
