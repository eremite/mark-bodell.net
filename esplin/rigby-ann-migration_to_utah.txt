### CHURCH EMIGRATION OF 1852

There were 22 companies of emigration in 1852 and also a perpetual Emigration
Fund Company. The Websters came in the Sixteenth Company of that year.
Following is taken from Emigration Records of 1852, Sixteenth Company, Captain
Uriah Curtis.

Captain Uriah Curtis was a speaker at a conference held in Big Pigeon
Tabernacle, Pottawattamie County, Iowa on April 7, 1852 on which occasion he
urged Saints to follow council and migrate to the Rocky Mountains 'where the
light was'. In charge of a company of saints from Pottawattamie County
numbering about 365, which had been organized by Elders Jedediah M. Grant and
Ezra T. Benson on June 24, 1852, and left the Missouri River a few days later,
arriving in Salt Lake City, October 1, 1852.

Margaret most probably crossed the plains in one of the companies in 1852 prior
to the one her folks came in, that of Uriah Curtis. Her sister, Lydia WEBSTER
BROOKS and family lived in St. Louis for a number of years, emigrating to the
Great Salt Lake in 1856, in John Banks Ox-Team Company. The members of her
family then consisted of James Simkins BROOKS, Jr. (husband) James S. BROOKS
III, age 8, son of the first wife, Rebecca Franklin CRUMP who died in St.
Louis; and Lydia's children, Lydia W. BROOKS, age 4, Rachel BROOKs, age 2 and
Milo Erastus BROOKS age 1. They arrived in Utah October 1, 1856
