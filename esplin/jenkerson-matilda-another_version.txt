Matilda Stolworthy, kneeling beside the cradle of her sick child, begged her
Heavenly Father to restore it to health. Feeling a breeze, she turned to see a
stranger standing in the room. He had a kindly face covered with a white beard,
and a peaceful countenance which gave Matilda the courage to offer him a chair.
"No, I just came to see your sick child." Laying his hands upon its head he
murmured a prayer in an unfamiliar tongue. Then, turning to Matilda, he assured
her that the baby would grow to womanhood to become the mother of ten. matilda
turned to note that the baby had gone to sleep. When he turned back the
stranger had gone. Outside she was able to trace his footsteps to the gate, but
no farther. Neighbors assured her that the stranger had been seen by no one
else. His promise was later fulfilled to the letter, and she always felt that a
Nephite had visited her.
