<p>William Covington born in Queen Anne’s County, Maryland about 1732 married Mary Wall July 26, 1750. He served as Captain in the Virginia Colonial Militia under Gen. George Washington in 1753, with Essex County Troops. (Virginia Colonial Militia by Crozier, page 96., Virginia State Papers, Vol. 1 page 247 tells how many men served under him. State Records of North Carolina Vol 16 page 1027 shows William Covington’s enlistment with the 4th North Carolina Regiment as March 28, 1777, died April 13, 1778. He was granted 2500 acres of land east of the Pee Dee River for his services as Adjutant to the Commanding General, 4th Teg. 11th Company. Records of the book, Kinfolks, page 443, 444 and Wills, plus deeds prove that these children are the ones born to William Covington and his wife, Mary Wall:</p>

<p>(1A) John Covington born about 1752, married Elizabeth Thomas born 1759, daughter of Reverend Robert Thomas and Mary Sands Thomas. John Covington’s Will, Feb 28, 1797, South Carolina</p>

The land called Providence was divided between John, Jr. and James, but other settlements were made to the other children, which leads one to believe that Benjamin, William and Henry were already removed elsewhere. in 1769 Thomas Dockery with his son-in-law, John Covington about 35 years old, and four children, Matthew, about 10, Hannah Covington, age about 7 1/2, Sarah Covington, age about 3 1/2, Mary Covington, age about 3 1/2 and others came to Anson County, having secured certificates of character from the church and Justice of Queen Anne’s Co.

Matthew Covington (9) was county surveyor 1780-86 in Richmond County, North Carolina and it is believed John Covington 92) and William 91) Covington taught this profession to their children.. anyway even to the present day some of the descendants are still surveyors… Capt. W.I. Everett was county surveyor until his death in 1911 in Richmond County.</p>

<p>Sarah Covington, daughter of Nehemiah, (11) and Rebecca Denwood Covington married first Edward Lloyd in 1703. She married (2) James Hollyday in 1721, son of Thomas and Mary Truman Hollyday. Sarah was born 1683/4, will proved 1755. Her father Nehemiah Covington and James Hollyday, and Edward Lloyd were three of the richest men at that time in Queen Anne’s Co. Maryland. St. Luke’s Church in Church Hill, Maryland was erected in 1729 and James Hollyday and family occupied pew no. 1. Sarah’s daughter Rebecca married at St. Luke’s Church. The Covingtons who came to Richmond County, North Carolina were members of this St. Luke’s Church and their weddings and births are recorded there… they were cousins of Sarah’s descending from Nehemiah Covington (1). Sarah built her mansions house, “Readbourne” after her marriage and when St. Paul’s Church was built in Centreville, Maryland, the “Readbourne” family changed to that. Here in this St. Paul’s church, Thomas Dockery, who came to North Carolina in 1769 with his son-in-law, John Covington (2) and four grandchildren, worshipped and was elected Elder in 1751, and held many prominent offices. Sarah’s son, James Hollyday, (11), was an outstanding layer, educated in England. There is a letter which James Hollyday wrote to his old friend, Thomas Dockery, in North Carolina in 1779, in the Maryland Historical Society. There are so many characteristics described concerning these Covingtons, their relations in Anson and Richmond Counties: Dancing and Banjo Music, listening to slaves sing, and just keeping a talented slave around who could sing, but was no good for anything else; giving land to slaves for their churches, and treating them so good that even when they were freed, they remained to die at what they called “home.” The Covingtons who came to North Carolina never forgot the stately mansion, “Readbourne” built by their kinswoman, Sarah Covington Lloyd Hollyday and many fine homes were built in North Carolina, Natchez, Mississippi; Casington, Mississippi; Westport, Connecticut; Chicago, Illinois; Kentucky, Georgia, Texas and anywhere a Covington owned land. Gracious living, many friends, good times, diligent in search for knowledge, good conversationalists, and as Major Robert Wells Covington wrote from his home in Kentucky in 1835, his rules for claiming kin to any Covington was: (1) the man must be upright, of good character and good citizens, (2) The woman must be beautiful (as most Covington women are), cultivated and attractive.</p>

<p>(6) Lieut. James Covington, son of William (1) and Mary Wall Covington was killed in Revolutionary War, Nov. 28, 1776. He was not married.</p>

<p>(7) Elizabeth Covington married Thomas Everett born 1772. Elizabeth born 1753, died 1820. Their line under Everett Family line.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. McSwain,</p>

<p>I have your letter of April 7th, and you must pardon me for not writing sooner. I visited out there (North Carolina) in 1912 and took dinner with the Neil Graham family. I cannot tell why but I was taught to say Mr. Neil Graham, and Cousin Rachel. She was the sister of your grandfather, Euclid Covington. I very distinctly remember Essie and Sallie Mae, and I very distinctly remember the time when Bascom Hamer and myself went home from school with Mr. Graham when he was our teacher, and Cousin Rachel put us to bed and told us to name the bed post, each one for a little girl and the one we looked at first the next morning would be the girl we would marry or be our sweetheart.</p>

<p>During our 1912 visit Alice and I attended a party in your home, and I met Alma and Ethel, daughters of Walter B. Covington. I was 27 years old at the time and they were very young girls.</p>

<p>I have a son who is a lawyer, attended Duke University in North Carolina and my daughter, Elizabeth is secretary to President Eisenhower in the White House.</p>

<p>I know that there were other children beside Uncle William Riley Covington born 1808 and my grandfather, Thomas who married Hannah Covington. I’ll write you again just as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Yours very truly,</p>

<p>(signed) Robert E. Covington</p>

<p>(102-J-12) Joseph Covington is the unborn child mentioned in William Covington’s Will of March 7, 1789 was born April 15, 1789, died Nov 2 1860 in Warren County Kentucky, married Nancy born April 16, 1789, died July 13, 1861. Joseph B. Covington was still paying tax on 125 acres of land on David’s Creek which flows into the Pee Dee river near Allenton, and Randle Church - the oldest Methodist Church in North Carolina in 1941, when Stanley county was cut off from Montgomery and Anson. This site is near the beginning of the old Plank road which swept across the upper section of Richmond County and made connection with the Cross Creek Road (Fayetteville). This road was laid out in 1772. Since Joseph B. Covington was the youngest child of William (102-J) and Rachel Thomas Covington, this land could have been the site of their old home place. Benjamin Covington, (102-J-8) married Rebecca Hunter, a sister of Hannah Hunter who married Thomas Roper, and the Ropers lived in this same vicinity on the east side of the Pee Dee River. Covingtons have lived in this section since Richmond County was erected from Anson, and even before, and William Covington (102J) was either a cousin or an Uncle of the two brothers: John Covington 92) who married Hannah Dockery in Oct. 8, 1758 at St. Luke’s Church, Church Hill, Maryland and William Covington (1) who married Mary Wall, July 26, 1750. We know by John Covington, Sr.‘s Will in 1767 that John (2) and William (1) were brothers, and settled around Morven and what is now Rockingham, North Carolina. Descendants of both sets of Covingtons sticking pretty close to land granted their first ancestors in the 1770’s.</p>
