<p>Willard H Esplin History (1968)</p>

<p>1912</p>

<p>I was born 12 September 1912, Orderville, Kane County, Utah. The place of birth was at home in an old home owned by a family of Brown&#8217;s before my parents purchased by my parents across the street down by the creek on the lot of Clyde Taits.</p>

<p>1919 (age 7)</p>

<p>Entered the 1st grade which was held in the west wing of the old Orderville Ward Chapel, my teacher was Zydie Crook.</p>

<p>2nd My second grade was in the same room in the old chapel taught by Miss Brown (I asked her to call me Mr. Esplin)</p>

<p>3rd In the East wing of Old Chapel, my teacher was Lucy HOlgate Englestead. Many of the class had whooping cough bad this year and were held back while just a few of us went on, Fen Covington, Esther Porter, Luclla Chamberlain, Florine Chamberlain.</p>

<p>4th grade was in the North wing of the old Rock School house standing where the parking lot is for the new school gym and music room. Vera Esplin was my teacher.</p>

<p>Willard H. Esplin History Jan. 5, 1969</p>

<p>About 1965, I started teaching the High Priest Orderville Ward Group, and have been leading the singing in Priesthood meetings, since before that date.</p>

<p>[I (Mark) remember him leading the singing while I was a young priesthood holder. He didn&#8217;t really beat time. He just waved his hand to get us started then let his voice do the leading.]</p>

<p>1969</p>

<p>I have been taking an inservice training class at CSU (SUSC) as a student Scholarship form the National Science Foundation. I started on August 19, we had 3 days brush up then we took a r day tour of all the Southern Parks and Monuments, sleeping in sleeping bags and cocking our meals. This class continues until May 1969 meeting 2 times each month on Saturday for 4 hours each time we meet. [Next part in Ruby Esplin&#8217;s writing] Good grades.</p>

<p>[I (Mark) remember daddy talking about this trip on a number of occasions. I remember him showing slides that a member of the group took and gave a copy of them to Dad. I remember him talking of taking a Gray Hound (at least a big bus) on the dirt roads and having to back up several times to make it around the turns, and how surprised people were to see such a big bus on such bad roads. I remember him telling about the bus getting stuck and of all the men getting off and pushing it to get it going.] Sept. 1958 W. H. Esplin</p>

<p>[I can remember hearing Dad tell about getting to school one year late because he had to work with the sheep and couldn&#8217;t get away earlier. He got there one week before the midterm exams. He nearly flunked out, but by the end of the quarter he was able to catch up.</p>

<p>I also remember him telling of having trouble with his brothers because he sold or wanted to sell off part of the herd of sheep to get ahead a little financially (remember this is during the recession) This disagreement helped him decide to go off to college since things weren&#8217;t going so smoothly.</p>

<p>I remember him telling of working for $.25 an hour hard labor to get money to continue in college. After he got a job milking the cows for the college dairy. We milked cows twice a day by hand, (a lot of cows). It was before dawn when he did the first milking.</p>

<p>[I remember him telling of in a class in trigonometry, I think at Dixie they used a transit to look down at the campus an measure the angles form a couple of locations on the overlooking hills and figuring out the distances. He said they didn&#8217;t use side rulers much, instead they used logritem tables.</p>

<p>He says the winter he spent at Dixie was one of the coldest winters he had because of the cold damp feel. ]</p>
