<p>I would like to pay tribute to my father for a number of reasons. It is difficult to enumerate them because I think all children take so much for granted. Until they have had the privilege of going through the same experience of being a parent, they have no practical way of understanding the unselfishness and compassion most parents demonstrate toward their children.</p>

<p>My father was so good to his wife and children. We were never in need of food and the necessities of life. He worked hard&#8211;frequently twelve hours a day&#8211;six days a week. He also planted a garden every year and we enjoyed the choice vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p>He was also thoughtful and considerate of his widowed sister, Hilda. He visited her regularly and would take her to town to get her groceries.</p>

<p>I remember my father telephoning my mother nearly every evening before he came home from work to inquire if there was something he should get for her.</p>

<p>The Christmas before Calvin was born my father did the shopping. He went all out and I thought we received the grandest gifts. As I remember&#8211;I got a camera, and the twins received darling sweaters.</p>

<p>My father was so thrilled with the miracle of radio. I often wonder what he would say about the marvels of television today.</p>

<p>I learned about the beauties of nature from a father who loved the canyons and rivers where he could fish. How I loved to eat the fish that he caught! He would feel our foreheads and say we could eat a little more because our foreheads were still a little soft.</p>

<p>Dad always encouraged us in our musical endeavors. Money for lessons didn&#8217;t come easy during the depression. He never complained about driving Erma to the numerous places she had been requested to play her violin.</p>

<p>During his last illness he was patient and appreciative of the care he received. His last concern was for the welfare of his children.</p>

<p>We, his children&#8211;Phyllis, Ruth, Ruby, Erma, and Calvin&#8211;are proud to be heirs to his name.</p>
