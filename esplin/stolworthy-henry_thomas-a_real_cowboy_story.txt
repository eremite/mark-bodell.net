# Buckskin Tom

### Henry Thomas Stolworthy (1860)
### by Matilda Staker??

Grandpa Stolworthy was a cowboy. He was a foreman of the United Order Cattle
and Sheep Company for 12 years, and the Indians blamed him for running cattle
on the Buckskin Mountains, which they considered belonged to them.

One day Buckskin Tom as the Indians called him, rode out to see about the
cattle. Old Moses, and Indian chief, watched him go, then took his gun and
followed. When he came to a path between two rock cliffs, Old Moses, knowing
that Buckskin Tom would have to come home that way, sat down to wait, intending
to kill him as he came between the cliffs.

But just before Buckskin Tom got to the cliff he stopped his horse to see about
some cattle there. A streak of lightning came from the sky and struck and
killed the horse. Stunned, Buckskin Tom fell with the horse, and Old Moses
thought he was dead. But he got up, pulled the saddle from the horse and went
home.

Old Moses went back to the Indians and said. "Don't bother Buckskin Tom any
more. If the Great Spirit can't kill him, the Indians can't". And after that
Buckskin Tom lived a charmed life. The Indians were afraid of him.
