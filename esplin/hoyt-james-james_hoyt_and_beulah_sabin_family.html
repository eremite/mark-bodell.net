        <h1 id='james_hoyt_and_beulah_sabin_family'>JAMES HOYT AND BEULAH SABIN FAMILY</h1>

<p>The history of this family in America begins with the arrival of one Paul Hoyt, in the town of Salisbury in Northwestern Massachusetts in the early 1600&#8217;s. Later records show Hoyts settled in Central New Hampshire, and that Hoyts served in the Colonial Army in the American Revolution.</p>

<p>This records begins with James Hoyt, son of Jedediah Hoyt and Hannah Elliott. James was born 25 January 1785 at Boscwen, Marrimac County, New Hampshire, a small settlement ten miles north of the capital city of Concord. Little is known of him except at age 20 he married Rachel Morse, 1805, a union which apparently terminated with no children. In 1807 he married Beulah Sabin of Richardson, Cheshire County down near the border of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>James would remember little of the revolutionary war, but he grew up during the struggles of the new nation. The young couple, twenty-two and twenty-one, moved westward into upper central New York soon after their marriage and established themselves in Boonville, Oneida County. There, thier first child, Pauline, was born on the 18 February 1808. All ten children were born there. They had six sons, and four daughters, the last, Harriet Sophia, born 20 July 1830.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly at that early date in the settlement of the new nation, they were founders of a new or young community. clearing land, farming, and perhaps dairying. The area was also timber land-cutting tumber for building may have provided a resource and activity for six growing boys.</p>

<p>It might be conjectured that this Hoyt family would have lived out their lives in central New York had not Mormon missionaries come through the area proclaiming the restoration of the true church of Jesus Christ. Family records do not show the Hoyts as adherents of any of the several churches common in the region, although they were God-fearing and Bible reading people. All of the family accepted the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the missionaries presented it. It was an action that uprooted them from a home and security of at least twenty-five years. Records are obscure as to baptism dates of all the family. They do reveal that Israel, the youngest, was baptized 11 July 1841 when he was thirteen years old.</p>

<p>The James Hoyt family moved to Nauvoo, Illinois after accepting membership in the Church. Known dates relative to the move to the center of the Church are obscure. Israel&#8217;s family records show he worked on the Nauvoo Temple at the age of Seventeen, and received temple ordinances at nearly 18, which would be after April 1845. History records temple ordinances were performed until June of 1846 until nearly all of the saints had left Nauvoo to begin their trek westward.</p>

<p>They Hoyts prepared with the others and traveled to Winter Quarters. In July 1846, the United States Government came to the L. D. S. colony to recruit 500 volunteers for a march to the West Coast. The two older Hoyt sons, Henry Pike, 31, and Timothy Sabin, 28, enlisted in the Battalion. Henry left his wife and child to travel west with his family; he died from deprivation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on 3 September 1847 without seeing his family again.</p>

<p>Timothy returned with the company to Salt Lake Valley. Young Israel, 18 years old at the time was away from the camp at Winter Quarters where the company was recruited and did not participate in the march.</p>

<p>The Hoyts became a part of the Jedediah M. Grany Pioneer companies, including President Young&#8217;s leading company, to cross the plains in the Sumer of 1947. Grant&#8217;s company was the third hundred of four hundreds. The journey began 17 June 1847. A detailed record of the third hundred&#8217;s travel to the Valley is given in the book &#8220;Mormon Thunder - A Documentary History of Jedediah Morgan Grant.&#8221;</p>

<p>All arrived in Salt Lake Valley by the 10th of October, the Grant Company being one of the last. Family history records that the Hoyts, Henry Pike&#8217;s wife, and the Josiah Miller family traveled together. In the Miller family was Clarissa Amanda whom Israel Married on 25 March 1848. President Young performed the ceremony.</p>

<p>The James Hoyt family built a cabin in the Fort at Salt Lake City where they spent the first years in the Valley. Both they and the Millers suffered the deprivations of the Saints through the years 1848-1850. In the summer of 1851, Israel was sent with several otehr men south eighty-eight miles to Salt Creek to harvest wild grass hay which grew in abundance over a wide flat valley. Their report back to the Presidency of the Church prompted a call to make a settlement at Salt Creek. Israel was among the first men called to move their families. A fort was built and the place named Nephi.</p>

<p>Israel&#8217;s parents, James and Beulah, accompanied Israel to the new settlement. His family now included Harriet Amanda, born 16 October 1850. Both parent were in less than good health, having experienced the hard labors and deprivations of migration and persecution of church members from New Hampshire to New York to Illinois, Iowa, and to Valleys of Mountains. James passed away 28 1853, Beulah followed him four years later on 12 December 1857. Both lie in the Nephi City Cemetery.</p>
