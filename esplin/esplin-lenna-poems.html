<h2 id='a_mothers_prayer'>A Mother&#8217;s Prayer</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m sitting by the window,<br />The lights are turned down low<br />I plainly see the Christmas star<br />That shone so long ago.</p>

<p>The room is warm and cozy.<br />The tree is tinsel bright.<br />It is a lovely place to be<br />On this cold and wintry night.</p>

<p>My heart is filled with happiness.<br />Yet my eyes are dim with tears.<br />I can&#8217;t help but remember<br />The pain of other years.</p>

<p>I see again my first born son.<br />His shinning reddish curls,<br />His precious soul imprisoned<br />In a body, crippled, spoiled.</p>

<p>We watched and waited, worked and prayed.<br />We had great faith; not fear.<br />We were hoping for a miracle<br />But he lived just eight short years.</p>

<p>At last my heart is mended<br />My soul is filled with peace.<br />The bitterness that chained me<br />Has finally found release.</p>

<p>We Mothers who have suffered<br />Implore thee now dear Lord<br />Don&#8217;t let them take our Stalwart Sons<br />Their loss we can&#8217;t afford.</p>

<p>Yet we must not let the children<br />Of this cruel atomic age<br />Be the victim of World leaders<br />Who are seeking to enslave.</p>

<p>Oh, God, who heals all sorrow<br />Look down this Christmas Eve.<br />Please heal the hearts of Nations,<br />That are filled with hate and greed.</p>

<p>Let the shining light of freedom,<br />Shine on all the world tonight<br />Let the people of all nations<br />Keep the Peace Star shining bright.</p>

<h2 id='when_pa_puts_up_the_christmas_tree'>When Pa Puts Up the Christmas Tree</h2>

<p>A few days before Christmas<br />After Ma&#8217;s constant naggin&#8217;<br />Pa finally decides<br />He must begin without lagging.</p>

<p>He gets out the nails, the hammer and saw<br />He clutters the kitchen &#8216;till I fell sorry for Ma.<br />He swears and he moans, he mutters and groans<br />We all stand aghast just listenin&#8217; to Pa.</p>

<p>He takes down the ornaments, the tinsel, and stars.<br />He keeps us all runnin&#8217; almost to Mars.<br />He shouts for the scissors, the tape, and the angle<br />And when he is done, we haven&#8217;t a worry<br />We all know the tree will stand with great glory.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a master-piece of beauty when he finally gets through.<br />And we all get to rest for a minute or two.<br />We gaze at the glory that Pa has created<br />As he drops on the couch as if he has fainted.</p>

<p>But it wouldn&#8217;t be Christmas without the excitement<br />of Pa and his temper<br />And His yearly assignment.</p>

<h1 id='i_hear_my_mother_singing'>I HEAR MY MOTHER SINGING</h1>

<p>I can stil hear my mother singing<br />In the kitchen down below<br />When I awakened in the morn<br />When I was a girl so long ago.</p>

<p>Her voice was strong and sweet then<br />In those years I used to know<br />And her songs all had a moral<br />Of the way that we should go.</p>

<p>My Mother&#8217;s getting old now,<br />She doesn&#8217;t sing much anymore.<br />She laughs and says her voice is cracked<br />When we beg her just one more.</p>

<p>I know she&#8217;s getting tired<br />After all the trouble she&#8217;s know;<br />But, please don&#8217;t give up now, Mother.<br />We need you, yet, you know.</p>

<p>Please keep on singing, Mother<br />For I know that up above<br />Father must be listening<br />To that voice that we all love</p>

<p>Maybe someday, way up yonder<br />We&#8217;ll all be together again.<br />And we&#8217;ll sing the Hallelujah Chorus<br />And we&#8217;ll make such a din<br />That the Lord will open up the gates<br />And let us all come in.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id='memories_of_home'>Memories of Home</h1>

<p>I see the white house on the hillside.<br />With its beauty against the high hill.<br />The home that we all loved and cherished<br />Is again with happiness filled.</p>

<p>I think of us there in the twilight<br />As we came home at the end of the day.<br />I see all those dear, loving faces,<br />As we knelt in the evening to pray.</p>

<p>The waterfall sounds in the distance,<br />The wind through the mulberry blows.<br />The birds call good-night from the treetops,<br />The cool breeze from the canyon flows.</p>

<p>The moon comes over white mountains<br />As we all prepare for the night<br />The Valley is peaceful and quiet<br />And we all feel safe and all right</p>

<p>I call the roll in my memory<br />As my mind goes back through the years.<br />And my heart yearns to return there<br />To our home filled with happiness and tears.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id='our_neighbor'>Our Neighbor</h1>

<p>There&#8217;s a house near ours across the street,<br />That&#8217;s a happy home so clean and neat.<br />Five happy children are growing up there<br />Who have always known love and tender care.</p>

<p>I sigh and turn from my window view<br />And brush from my eyes a tear or two<br />Death the Grim Reaper came last night<br />And took from his home its bright shining light</p>

<p>I remember with love this Mother&#8217;s kind ways.<br />Her faith and devotion in happier days.<br />And I wonder why sadness should come today<br />To a home so perfect in every way.</p>

<p>But dear kindly neighbor this I know<br />Your children will know the way to go<br />God in his mercy will heal their tears<br />And lead them genlty through the years.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id='sister'>Sister</h1>

<p>Dear little sister I&#8217;m sad today,<br />I weep because you have gone away.<br />I know it was better for you to go<br />But it&#8217;s lonely for us you left here below.</p>

<p>I wish somehow I could atone,<br />For the years you felt so all alone.<br />I know you had many troubles to bear,<br />Why didn&#8217;t I make more effort to share?</p>

<p>The death of a mother is hard to bear<br />But as a family, they&#8217;ll learn to share<br />They&#8217;ll do something useful in this life<br />They&#8217;ll get along in trouble and strife.</p>

<p>Dear little sister this I believe,<br />You can rest in peace and sweet relief.<br />Your children will find the way to go,<br />You&#8217;ve taught them better than you know.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id='my_daughter'>My Daughter</h1>

<p>God gave me a daughter<br />A gift from above.<br />Nothing more precious<br />Could he send me to love.</p>

<p>For eighteen short years<br />I treasured each moment.<br />She brought hope, peace, and love<br />To a life badly shattered.</p>

<p>Now I must let her leave our home;<br />She wants to test her wings alone.<br />It breaks my heart to see her go<br />But it can&#8217;t be otherwise I know.</p>

<p>Oh, God! Let her find happiness in this life<br />She will make some good man, a very fine wife.<br />Let her find goodness; not too much strife<br />She has so much happiness to offer life.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id='our_son'>Our Son</h1>

<p>We had one little boy just full of fun,<br />Tired and weary when day was done.<br />Marbles, string and trash galore,<br />Dumped upon his bedroom floor.</p>

<p>Just one little boy makes work to do<br />Washing and mending and much cleaning too.<br />Well balanced meals to make him grow<br />Watching and planning all for you.</p>

<p>But oh how I miss that little rough boy,<br />Our home is so empty without all his noise.<br />I miss all the excitement and cooking and such<br />I really loved it all very much.</p>

<p>We gave him up to the big wide world.<br />We had faith in him and the Lord above.<br />I hope our teachings meant something to him.<br />He&#8217;ll need lots of faith, before he is through.</p>

<p>But Son keep your course both straight and true.<br />Work long and hard; good men are too few.<br />But if I have failed in you my son,<br />I&#8217;ve failed in everything I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id='christmas_eve'>Christmas Eve</h1>

<p>Parents everywhere tonight<br />Because it&#8217;s Christmas Eve<br />Gather your children around you<br />Let nothing intercede.</p>

<p>Children will always remember the happiness<br />That home and Christmas bring<br />And the lessons they learn at your hearthside<br />Give them standards to which they will cling.</p>

<p>Too soon your children will leave you<br />So before it becomes to late<br />Teach them of God and his kingdom<br />And the choices they must make.</p>

<p>Love them and draw them near you<br />Your years to have them are few.<br />Show them the true meaning of Christmas<br />And the gifts that God will always renew.</p>
