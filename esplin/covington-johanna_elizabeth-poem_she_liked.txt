The following verse was found among Mother's papers. It sounds so much like
her, because whatever her burdens, she could always smile. Note by Chastie

# MY CONSOLATION

by Ben Burroughs

    When the weight of life is heavy
    And my heart is full of pain,
    I reach out for consolation
    To help drive away the rain.
    I will raise my eyes to heaven
    And ask God to see me through,
    And then just as if by magic
    All my gray skies turn to blue.
    So the miracle or praying
    Makes me smile instead of frown,
    For my God above will raise me
    When I'm bending and I'm down.
