Benson on June 24, 1852, and left the Missouri River a few days later, arriving in Salt Lake City, October 1, 1852.</p>

<p>Margaret most probably crossed the plains in one of the companies in 1852 prior to the one her folks came in, that of Uriah Curtis. Her sister, Lydia WEBSTER BROOKS and family lived in St. Louis for a number of years, emigrating to the Great Salt Lake in 1856, in John Banks Ox-Team Company. The members of her family then consisted of James Simkins BROOKS, Jr. (husband) James S. BROOKS III, age 8, son of the first wife, Rebecca Franklin CRUMP who died in St. Louis; and Lydia&#8217;s children, Lydia W. BROOKS, age 4, Rachel BROOKs, age 2 and Milo Erastus BROOKS age 1.
